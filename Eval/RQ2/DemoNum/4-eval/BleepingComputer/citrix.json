        "text": "Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.",
