        "text": "Organizations in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) sector are in the crosshairs of an Iranian threat actor as part of a campaign designed to deliver a never-before-seen backdoor called FalseFont. The findings come from Microsoft, which is tracking the activity under its weather-themed moniker Peach Sandstorm (formerly Holmium), which is also known as APT33, Elfin, and Refined Kitten. FalseFont is a custom backdoor with a wide range of functionalities that allow operators to remotely access an infected system, launch additional files, and send information to its [command-and-control] servers. In a report published in September 2023, Microsoft linked the group to password spray attacks carried out against thousands of organizations globally between February and July 2023. The intrusions primarily singled out satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors. The end goal, the company said, is to facilitate intelligence collection in support of Iranian state interests. Peach Sandstorm is believed to have been active since at least 2013. The disclosure comes as the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) accused Iran and Hezbollah of attempting to unsuccessfully target Ziv Hospital through hacking crews named Agrius and Lebanese Cedar.",
