The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.",
