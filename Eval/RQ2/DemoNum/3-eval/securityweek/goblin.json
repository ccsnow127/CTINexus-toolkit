        "text": "A financially motivated threat actor has been targeting one-day vulnerabilities in public-facing services to deploy Linux backdoors, Check Point reports. Tracked as Magnet Goblin, the adversary was seen quickly adopting one-day vulnerabilities, often in edge devices, and relying on the Nerbian custom malware family to perform nefarious activities. Magnet Goblin was seen targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Ivanti VPNs (CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, CVE-2024-21888, and CVE-2024-21893), Magento (CVE-2022-24086), Qlik Sense (CVE-2023-41265, CVE-2023-41266, and CVE-2023-48365), and possibly Apache ActiveMQ. As part of an attack exploiting the recent Ivanti flaws, the threat actor was observed deploying a JavaScript credential stealer called Warpwire, a Linux variant of the NerbianRAT backdoor, and the open source tunneling tool Ligolo. The Warpwire stealer was previously linked to the mass exploitation of Ivanti vulnerabilities, suggesting that multiple threat actors might be using it, Check Point says. The tool was also seen in a 2022 attack against Magento servers, which were used as command-and-control (C&C) servers for the Windows variant of NerbianRAT and for Warpwire. Magnet Goblin deployed MiniNerbian, a smaller version of the Linux NerbianRAT backdoor, on the compromised Magento instances.",
