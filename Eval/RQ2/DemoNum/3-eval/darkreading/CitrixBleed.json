Even after it was brought to light in October, many organizations have struggled to comprehensively shore up their systems. One such organization appears to be Comcast Xfinity. On Monday, the cable giant disclosed a CitrixBleed-enabled breach of its customer data, including usernames and hashed passwords, and, for some, names, contact information, last four digits of Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and security questions and answers.",
