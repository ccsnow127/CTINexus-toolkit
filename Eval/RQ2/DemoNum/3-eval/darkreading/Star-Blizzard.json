        "text": "Star Blizzard (aka Seaborgium, BlueCharlie, Callisto Group, and Coldriver) has been carrying out email credential theft in service of cyberespionage and cyber influence campaigns since at least 2017. Historically, it has focused its aim on public and private organizations in NATO member countries, typically in fields related to politics, defense, and related sectors \u2014 NGOs, think tanks, journalists, academic institutions, intergovernmental organizations, and so on. In recent years, it has especially targeted individuals and organizations providing support for Ukraine. To aid in sneaking past email filters, Star Blizzard has started using password-protected PDF lure documents, or links to cloud-based file sharing platforms with the protected PDFs contained within. The passwords to these documents typically come packaged in the same phishing email, or an email sent shortly after the first.",
