According to researchers at Proofpoint, state-sponsored hackers have attempted to abuse the Follina vulnerability in Microsoft Office, aiming an email-based exploit at U.S. and E.U. government targets via phishing campaigns. Proofpoint researchers spotted the attacks and believe the adversaries have ties to a government, which it did not identify. Attacks consist of campaigns targeting victims U.S. and E.U. government workers. Malicious emails contain fake recruitment pitches promising a 20 percent boost in salaries and entice recipients to download an accompanying attachment. The malicious attachment targets the remote code execution bug CVE-2022-30190, dubbed Follina.",
