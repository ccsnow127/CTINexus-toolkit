Example 1:

'CTI': CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Despite first being detected six years ago, malicious attackers continue to use the Magniber ransomware to compromise organizations. In October 2022, phishing attacks were reported to distribute the Magniber ransomware using standalone JavaScript files digitally signed with a malformed key, exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2022-44698 to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security warnings, and allowing malicious files to be executed without raising alerts. Microsoft later patched this vulnerability in December 2022. Formerly known as a successor of Cerber, the Magniber ransomware was primarily distributed via the Magnitude exploit kit and exclusively targeted South Korea in 2017. In 2018, it expanded its targets across Asia using CVE-2018-8174 for initial access.
