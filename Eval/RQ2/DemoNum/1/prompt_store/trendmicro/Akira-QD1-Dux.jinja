Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Cisco released a security advisory on Sept. 6, 2023, stating that Akira ransomware operators exploited CVE-2023-20269, a zero-day vulnerability in two of their products' remote access VPN feature: the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software and Cisco Firepower Thread Defense (FTD) software. Cisco reported that malicious actors who exploit CVE-2023-20269 can identify valid credentials that could be abused to establish unauthorized remote access VPN sessions, and for victims running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier, establish a clientless SSL VPN session. Recently, Sentinel One released a video analyzing an Akira ransomware variant named Megazord that emerged in August 2023. This variant appears to be referencing a Power Rangers formation because it encrypts files with the \u201cPOWERRANGES\u201d file extension. The ransom note, which is named \u201cpowerranges.txt,\u201d instructs victims to contact the ransomware actor via TOX messenger.
