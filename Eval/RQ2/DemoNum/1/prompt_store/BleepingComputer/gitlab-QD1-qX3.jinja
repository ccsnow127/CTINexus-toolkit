Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': Mastodon, the free and open-source decentralized social networking platform, has fixed a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to impersonate and take over any remote account. The newly fixed flaw is tracked as CVE-2024-23832 and stems from insufficient origin validation in Mastodon, allowing attackers to impersonate users and take over their accounts. In July 2023, the Mastodon team fixed another critical bug tracked as CVE-2023-36460 and dubbed 'TootRoot,' which allowed attackers to send 'toots' (the equivalent of tweets) that would create web shells on target instances. Attackers could leverage this flaw to completely compromise Mastodon servers, allowing them to access sensitive user information, communications, and plant backdoors.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.
