Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report. Your response must be JSON and nothing else.

Example 1:

'CTI': The threat actor known as UAC-0050 is leveraging phishing attacks to distribute Remcos RAT using new strategies to evade detection from security software. The group's weapon of choice is Remcos RAT, a notorious malware for remote surveillance and control, which has been at the forefront of its espionage arsenal. However, in their latest operational twist, the UAC-0050 group has integrated a pipe method for interprocess communication, showcasing their advanced adaptability. UAC-0050, active since 2020, has a history of targeting Ukrainian and Polish entities via social engineering campaigns that impersonate legitimate organizations to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. In February 2023, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the adversary to a phishing campaign designed to deliver Remcos RAT.

Target report:

\"CTI\": PurpleFox (or 'DirtyMoe') is a modular Windows botnet malware first spotted in 2018 that comes with a rootkit module allowing it to hide and persist between device reboots. It can be used as a downloader that introduces more potent second-stage payloads on compromised systems, offers its operators backdoor capabilities, and can also act as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot. In October 2021, researchers noticed that new versions of PurpleFox switched to using WebSocket for command and control (C2) communications for stealth. In January 2022, a campaign spread the malware under the guise of a Telegram desktop app. CERT-UA used IoCs shared by Avast and TrendMicro to identify PurpleFox malware infections on Ukrainian computers, tracking the activity under the identifier 'UAC-0027'. CERT-UA says PurpleFox typically infects systems when victims launch laced MSI installers and highlights its self-propagation capabilities using exploits for known flaws and password brute-forcing.
