Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft has released a workaround for a zero-day flaw that was initially flagged in April and that attackers already have used to target organizations in Russia and Tibet, researchers said. The remote control execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-3019, is associated with the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), which, ironically, itself collects information about bugs in the company\u2019s products and reports to Microsoft Support. If successfully exploited, attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user\u2019s rights, the company said. A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word,\u201d Microsoft explained in its guidance on the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Ransomware groups are abusing unpatched versions of a Linux-based Mitel VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) application and using it as a springboard plant malware on targeted systems. The critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-29499, was first report by Crowdstrike in April as a zero-day vulnerability and is now patched. Mitel is popularly known for providing business phone systems and unified communication as a service (UCaaS) to all forms of organizations. The Mitel focuses on VoIP technology allowing users to make phone calls using an internet connection instead of regular telephone lines.
