Example 1:

'CTI': In February 2022, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and the National Security Agency (NSA) released a joint statement regarding their observation of Iranian government-sponsored APT MuddyWater and their malicious cyber activity. MuddyWater is known for cyber espionage, as well as other cybercriminal operations as part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The threat actors have targeted several government and private sector organizations in the defense, oil and natural gas, local government, and telecommunications industries - focusing on Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. MuddyWater conducts broad cyber campaigns, exploiting publicly reported vulnerabilities and using open-source tools and strategies to gain access to their target's systems. Also, known as MERCURY, Earth Vetala, Static Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros, MuddyWater is an Iranian APT and a subservient element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The group has been active since 2018 and has provided stolen data and access to the Iranian government by exploiting known vulnerabilities and using open-source tools to deploy their ransomware. In November 2021, Cisco Talos observed a campaign targeting Turkey government entities, including the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey - Tubitak. MuddyWater has three goals when conducting their attacks: cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, and ransomware attacks.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Iranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations operating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania. Seedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many countries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle East. It has been publicly stated that Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed to be a subordinate part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023, including leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recently discovered and documented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated. The attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have previously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging tool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools.
