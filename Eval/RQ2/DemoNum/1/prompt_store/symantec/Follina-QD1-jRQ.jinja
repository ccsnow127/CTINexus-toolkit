Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft has released a workaround for a zero-day flaw that was initially flagged in April and that attackers already have used to target organizations in Russia and Tibet, researchers said. The remote control execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-3019, is associated with the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), which, ironically, itself collects information about bugs in the company\u2019s products and reports to Microsoft Support. If successfully exploited, attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user\u2019s rights, the company said. A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word,\u201d Microsoft explained in its guidance on the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Follina (CVE-2022-30190) is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that allows remote code execution on vulnerable systems through the ms-msdt protocol handler scheme. The bug is present in all supported versions of Windows. The vulnerability can be easily exploited by a specially crafted Word document that downloads and loads a malicious HTML file through Word's remote template feature. The HTML file ultimately allows the attacker to load and execute PowerShell code within Windows. The vulnerability can also be exploited through the RTF file format.
