Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft Threat Intelligence continues to track and disrupt malicious activity attributed to a Russian state-sponsored actor we track as Star Blizzard (formerly SEABORGIUM, also known as COLDRIVER and Callisto Group). Star Blizzard has improved their detection evasion capabilities since 2022 while remaining focused on email credential theft against the same targets. Star Blizzard, whose activities we assess to have historically supported both espionage and cyber influence objectives, continues to prolifically target individuals and organizations involved in international affairs, defense, and logistics support to Ukraine, as well as academia, information security companies, and other entities aligning with Russian state interests. Microsoft continues to refine and deploy protections against Star Blizzard's evolving spear-phishing tactics.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Star Blizzard (aka Seaborgium, BlueCharlie, Callisto Group, and Coldriver) has been carrying out email credential theft in service of cyberespionage and cyber influence campaigns since at least 2017. Historically, it has focused its aim on public and private organizations in NATO member countries, typically in fields related to politics, defense, and related sectors \u2014 NGOs, think tanks, journalists, academic institutions, intergovernmental organizations, and so on. In recent years, it has especially targeted individuals and organizations providing support for Ukraine. To aid in sneaking past email filters, Star Blizzard has started using password-protected PDF lure documents, or links to cloud-based file sharing platforms with the protected PDFs contained within. The passwords to these documents typically come packaged in the same phishing email, or an email sent shortly after the first.
