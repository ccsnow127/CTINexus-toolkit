The initial remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been dubbed Log4Shell and has dominated cyber-security news ever since it was publicly disclosed on December 9. The vulnerability has been exploited to deploy a plethora of payloads like coin miners, Dridex malware, and even ransomware such as Conti.",
