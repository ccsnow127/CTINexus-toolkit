Example 1:

'CTI': In February 2022, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and the National Security Agency (NSA) released a joint statement regarding their observation of Iranian government-sponsored APT MuddyWater and their malicious cyber activity. MuddyWater is known for cyber espionage, as well as other cybercriminal operations as part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The threat actors have targeted several government and private sector organizations in the defense, oil and natural gas, local government, and telecommunications industries - focusing on Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. MuddyWater conducts broad cyber campaigns, exploiting publicly reported vulnerabilities and using open-source tools and strategies to gain access to their target's systems. Also, known as MERCURY, Earth Vetala, Static Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros, MuddyWater is an Iranian APT and a subservient element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The group has been active since 2018 and has provided stolen data and access to the Iranian government by exploiting known vulnerabilities and using open-source tools to deploy their ransomware. In November 2021, Cisco Talos observed a campaign targeting Turkey government entities, including the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey - Tubitak. MuddyWater has three goals when conducting their attacks: cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, and ransomware attacks.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Budworm advanced persistent threat (APT) group continues to actively develop its toolset. Most recently, the Threat Hunter Team in Symantec, part of Broadcom, discovered Budworm using an updated version of one of its key tools to target a Middle Eastern telecommunications organization and an Asian government. Both attacks occurred in August 2023. Budworm (aka LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27) deployed a previously unseen variant of its SysUpdate backdoor (SysUpdate DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll). SysUpdate is exclusively used by Budworm. As well as its custom malware, Budworm also used a variety of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in these attacks. It appears the activity by the group may have been stopped early in the attack chain as the only malicious activity seen on infected machines is credential harvesting.

Example 3:

'CTI': Iranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations operating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania. Seedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many countries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle East. It has been publicly stated that Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed to be a subordinate part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023, including leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recently discovered and documented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated. The attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have previously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging tool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Grayfly (aka GREF and Wicked Panda) is a targeted attack group that has been active since at least March 2017 using a custom backdoor known as Backdoor.Motnug (aka TOMMYGUN/CROSSWALK), a custom loader called Trojan.Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka Trojan.Agentemis), and ancillary tools in its attacks. Grayfly has been observed targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North America across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, and telecommunications. In more recent activity, Grayfly has continued with its focus on telecommunications but has also been observed targeting organizations operating within the media, finance, and IT service provider sectors. Typically Grayfly targets publicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading further within the network. Once a network has been compromised, Grayfly may install its custom backdoors onto additional systems. These tools allow the attackers to have comprehensive remote access to the network and proxy connections allowing them to access hard-to-reach segments of a target's network. Although sometimes labeled APT41, we consider Grayfly the espionage arm of APT41. Similarly, Symantec tracks other sub-groups of APT41 separately, such as Blackfly, its cyber-crime arm.
