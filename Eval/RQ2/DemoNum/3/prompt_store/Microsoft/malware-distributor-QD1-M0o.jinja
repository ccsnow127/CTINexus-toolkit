Example 1:

'CTI': Although Ragnar Locker was discovered by the FBI in April 2020, the group has actually been active since December 2019. Ragnar Locker is both the name of the ransomware group and the name of the ransomware. The gang works as a part of a ransomware family, which means they are associated with several ransomware variants or threat actor groups. Ragnar Locker is known for using the double extortion tactic, which involves threat actors exfiltrating sensitive data, then triggering the encryption attack, and ultimately threatening to leak the data if the demanded ransom isn't paid. To avoid prevention and detection, the threat actor frequently changes their obfuscation techniques. Ragnar Locker initiates their attacks by compromising the networks of companies through RDP service - using brute force to guess passwords or using stolen credentials purchased on the dark web. After compromising their target's network, the threat actor elevates their privileges by exploiting CVE-2017-0213 found in Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler. According to Microsoft, CVE-2017-0213 is an elevation of privilege that allows attackers to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker runs a specially crafted application.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft Threat Intelligence has identified highly targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard (previously tracked as NOBELIUM). This latest attack, combined with past activity, further demonstrates Midnight Blizzard's ongoing execution of their objectives using both new and common techniques. In this latest activity, the threat actor uses previously compromised Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses to create new domains that appear as technical support entities. Using these domains from compromised tenants, Midnight Blizzard leverages Teams messages to send lures that attempt to steal credentials from a targeted organization by engaging a user and eliciting approval of multifactor authentication (MFA) prompts. As with any social engineering lures, we encourage organizations to reinforce security best practices to all users and reinforce that any authentication requests not initiated by the user should be treated as malicious.

Example 3:

'CTI': Since mid-November 2023, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors, including financially motivated actors like Storm-0569, Storm-1113, Sangria Tempest, and Storm-1674, utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme (App Installer) to distribute malware. In addition to ensuring that customers are protected from observed attacker activity, Microsoft investigated the use of App Installer in these attacks. In response to this activity, Microsoft has disabled the ms-appinstaller protocol handler by default. The observed threat actor activity abuses the current implementation of the ms-appinstaller protocol handler as an access vector for malware that may lead to ransomware distribution. Multiple cybercriminals are also selling a malware kit as a service that abuses the MSIX file format and ms-appinstaller protocol handler. These threat actors distribute signed malicious MSIX application packages using websites accessed through malicious advertisements for legitimate popular software. A second vector of phishing through Microsoft Teams is also in use by Storm-1674.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-0324 is a financially motivated group known to gain initial access using email-based initial infection vectors and then hand off access to compromised networks to other threat actors. These handoffs frequently lead to ransomware deployment. Beginning in July 2023, Storm-0324 was observed distributing payloads using an open-source tool to send phishing lures through Microsoft Teams chats. This activity is not related to the Midnight Blizzard social engineering campaigns over Teams that we observed beginning in May 2023. Because Storm-0324 hands off access to other threat actors, identifying and remediating Storm-0324 activity can prevent more dangerous follow-on attacks like ransomware.Storm-0324 (DEV-0324), which overlaps with threat groups tracked by other researchers as TA543 and Sagrid, acts as a distributor in the cybercriminal economy, providing a service to distribute the payloads of other attackers through phishing and exploit kit vectors.  Storm-0324's tactics focus on highly evasive infection chains with payment and invoice lures. The actor is known to distribute the JSSLoader malware, which facilitates access for the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor Sangria Tempest (ELBRUS, Carbon Spider, FIN7). Previous distribution activity associated with Storm-0324 included the Gozi infostealer and the Nymaim downloader and locker.
