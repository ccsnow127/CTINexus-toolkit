Example 1:

'CTI': A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-51467, resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-49070, CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month. CVE-2023-49070 refers to a pre-authenticated remote code execution flaw impacting versions prior to 18.12.10 that, when successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to gain full control over the server and siphon sensitive data. It is caused due to a deprecated XML-RPC component within Apache OFBiz. CVE-2023-51467 could be triggered using empty and invalid USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters in an HTTP request to return an authentication success message, effectively circumventing the protection and enabling a threat actor to access otherwise unauthorized internal resources.

Example 2:

'CTI': Follina (CVE-2022-30190) is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that allows remote code execution on vulnerable systems through the ms-msdt protocol handler scheme. The bug is present in all supported versions of Windows. The vulnerability can be easily exploited by a specially crafted Word document that downloads and loads a malicious HTML file through Word's remote template feature. The HTML file ultimately allows the attacker to load and execute PowerShell code within Windows. The vulnerability can also be exploited through the RTF file format.

Example 3:

'CTI': Microsoft is urging users to patch a zero-day vulnerability dubbed Dogwalk that is actively being exploited in the wild. The bug (CVE-2022-34713) is tied to a Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool and allows a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system. The warning is part of a massive August Patch Tuesday update that included 121 flaws, 17 of which were critical and 101 carrying a Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating of Important. Microsoft states that CVE-2022-34713 is a \u201cvariant of\u201d Dogwalk, but different. Microsoft scored the vulnerability as Important and warns that the exploitation of the bug can only be preformed by an adversary with physical access to a vulnerable computer.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A Windows 11 vulnerability, part of Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday roundup of fixes, is being exploited in the wild, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to advise patching of the elevation of privileges flaw by August 2. The recommendation is directed at federal agencies and concerns CVE-2022-22047, a vulnerability that carries a CVSS score of high (7.8) and exposes Windows Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) used in Windows 11 (and earlier versions dating back to 7) and also Windows Server 2022 (and earlier versions 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019) to attack. The CSRSS bug is an elevation of privileges vulnerability that allows adversaries with a pre-established foothold on a targeted system to execute code as an unprivileged user. When the bug was first reported by Microsoft\u2019s own security team earlier this month it was classified as a zero-day, or a known bug with no patch.
