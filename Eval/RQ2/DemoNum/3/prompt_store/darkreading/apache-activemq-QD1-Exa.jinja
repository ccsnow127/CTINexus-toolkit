Example 1:

'CTI': Although Ragnar Locker was discovered by the FBI in April 2020, the group has actually been active since December 2019. Ragnar Locker is both the name of the ransomware group and the name of the ransomware. The gang works as a part of a ransomware family, which means they are associated with several ransomware variants or threat actor groups. Ragnar Locker is known for using the double extortion tactic, which involves threat actors exfiltrating sensitive data, then triggering the encryption attack, and ultimately threatening to leak the data if the demanded ransom isn't paid. To avoid prevention and detection, the threat actor frequently changes their obfuscation techniques. Ragnar Locker initiates their attacks by compromising the networks of companies through RDP service - using brute force to guess passwords or using stolen credentials purchased on the dark web. After compromising their target's network, the threat actor elevates their privileges by exploiting CVE-2017-0213 found in Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler. According to Microsoft, CVE-2017-0213 is an elevation of privilege that allows attackers to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker runs a specially crafted application.

Example 2:

'CTI': Unknown groups have launched probes against a zero-day vulnerability identified in Apache's OfBiz enterprise resource planning (ERP) framework - an increasingly popular strategy of analyzing patches for ways to bypass software fixes. The 0-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-51467) in Apache OFBiz, disclosed on Dec. 26, allows an attacker to access sensitive information and remotely execute code against applications using the ERP framework, according to an analysis by cybersecurity firm SonicWall. The Apache Software Foundation had originally released a patch for a related issue, CVE-2023-49070, but the fix failed to protect against other variations of the attack.

Example 3:

'CTI': Threat actors are using public exploits to pummel a critical zero-day remote code execution (RCE) flaw that affects all versions of a popular collaboration tool used in cloud and hybrid server environments and allows for complete host takeover.Researchers from Volexity uncovered the flaw in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center software over the Memorial Day weekend after they detected suspicious activity on two internet-facing web servers belonging to a customer running the software, they said in a blog post published last week. The researchers tracked the activity to a public exploit for the vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, that\u2019s been spreading rapidly, and subsequently reported the flaw to Atlassian. As observed by Volexity researchers, what\u2019s being described as an \u201cOGNL injection vulnerability\u201d appears to allow for a Java Server Page (JSP) webshell to be written into a publicly accessible web directory on Confluence software.

Target report:

\"CTI\": More than 3,000 Internet-accessible Apache ActiveMQ Servers are exposed to a critical remote code execution vulnerability that an attacker has begun actively targeting to drop ransomware. The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) disclosed the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-46604, on Oct. 27. The bug allows a remote attacker with access to an ActiveMQ message broker to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems. Proof-of-concept exploit code and full details of the vulnerability are publicly available, meaning that threat actors have both the means and the information to launch attacks against the vulnerability. Researchers at Rapid7 reported observing exploit activity targeting the flaw at two customer locations, starting the same day that ASF disclosed the threat. In both instances, the adversary attempted to deploy ransomware binaries on target systems in an effort to ransom the victim organizations. They described both targeted organizations as running outdated versions of Apache ActiveMQ. The researchers attributed the malicious activity to the HelloKitty ransomware family, based on the ransom note and other attack attributes. HelloKitty ransomware has been percolating in the wild since at least 2020. Its operators have tended to favor double-extortion attacks in which they have not just encrypted the data but also stolen it as additional leverage for extracting a ransom from victims. The HelloKitty ransomware attacks leveraging the ActiveMQ flaw appeared somewhat rudimentary. In one of the attacks, the threat actor made more than a half dozen attempts to encrypt the data, prompting the researchers to label to threat actor as 'clumsy' in their report.
