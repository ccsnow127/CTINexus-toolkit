Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Example 2:

'CTI': In early 2023, it was revealed that the Clop ransomware gang had breached 130 companies and organizations by leveraging a critical remote code execution flaw in GoAnywhere MFT. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-0669 and had been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability since January 18, 2023. Fortra discovered its exploitation on February 3, 2023, and released patches three days later. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, with Clop conducting widespread data theft attacks that impacted organizations worldwide, causing data leaks, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. Some notable victims of those attacks include Crown Resorts, CHS, Hatch Bank, Rubrik, the City of Toronto, Hitachi Energy, Procter & Gamble, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In November 2021, security researchers detected malicious activity by Clop operators that exploited a SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability to breach corporate networks and deliver the Clop ransomware as a payload. The Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-35211, allowed RCE on the vulnerable server with elevated privileges. A maritime services giant with headquarters in Singapore also fell prey to Clop. In November 2021, it was reported that Clop breached its IT systems to steal classified proprietary commercial information and employee data that included bank account details, payroll information, passports, email addresses, and internal correspondence, among others. In October 2022, Microsoft Security reported that DEV-0950, a ransomware group that appears to be associated with the cybercriminal group FIN11 (aka TA505), distributed Clop in a campaign that targeted one of the victims of the Raspberry Robin worm.
