Example 1:

'CTI': Google has released security updates to fix the first Chrome zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild since the start of the year. \u200bThe high-severity zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-0519) is due to a high-severity out-of-bounds memory access weakness in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which remote attackers can exploit via a crafted HTML page to gain access to data beyond the memory buffer through heap corruption, providing them access to sensitive information or triggering a crash. Besides unauthorized access to out-of-bounds memory, CVE-2024-0519 could also be exploited to bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR to make it easier to achieve code execution via another weakness.

Example 2:

'CTI': Unknown groups have launched probes against a zero-day vulnerability identified in Apache's OfBiz enterprise resource planning (ERP) framework - an increasingly popular strategy of analyzing patches for ways to bypass software fixes. The 0-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-51467) in Apache OFBiz, disclosed on Dec. 26, allows an attacker to access sensitive information and remotely execute code against applications using the ERP framework, according to an analysis by cybersecurity firm SonicWall. The Apache Software Foundation had originally released a patch for a related issue, CVE-2023-49070, but the fix failed to protect against other variations of the attack.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-51467, resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-49070, CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month. CVE-2023-49070 refers to a pre-authenticated remote code execution flaw impacting versions prior to 18.12.10 that, when successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to gain full control over the server and siphon sensitive data. It is caused due to a deprecated XML-RPC component within Apache OFBiz. CVE-2023-51467 could be triggered using empty and invalid USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters in an HTTP request to return an authentication success message, effectively circumventing the protection and enabling a threat actor to access otherwise unauthorized internal resources.
