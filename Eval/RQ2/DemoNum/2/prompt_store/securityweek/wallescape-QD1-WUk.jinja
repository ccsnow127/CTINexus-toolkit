Example 1:

'CTI': Threat actors are exploiting a critical vulnerability in Magento to inject a persistent backdoor into ecommerce websites, cybersecurity firm Sansec reports. The issue, tracked as CVE-2024-20720 (CVSS score of 9.1), is described as an OS command injection flaw leading to arbitrary code execution without user interaction. Adobe resolved the critical vulnerability in February 2024 in both Adobe Commerce and Magento, as part of its Tuesday Patch updates. However, it appears that there are websites that have yet to be updated and remain vulnerable to exploitation. According to Sansec, threat actors have discovered a clever way to exploit CVE-2024-20720, using a crafted layout template in the database to inject XML code that can reinfect Magento servers even after a manual fix. Attackers combine the Magento layout parser with the beberlei/assert package (installed by default) to execute system commands. Because the layout block is tied to the checkout cart, this command is executed whenever <store>/checkout/cart is requested. As part of the observed attacks, the backdoor is added to the automatically generated content management system (CMS) controller, ensuring the backdoor is periodically reinjected and providing persistent remote code execution via POST commands. The threat actors have employed the mechanism to inject a fake Stripe payment skimmer and steal payment data from the compromised web stores.

Example 2:

'CTI': Google has rolled out security updates for the Chrome web browser to address a high-severity zero-day flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-7024, has been described as a heap-based buffer overflow bug in the WebRTC framework that could be exploited to result in program crashes or arbitrary code execution. Cl\u00e9ment Lecigne and Vlad Stolyarov of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on December 19, 2023. No other details about the security defect have been released to prevent further abuse, with Google acknowledging that an exploit for CVE-2023-7024 exists in the wild. Given that WebRTC is an open-source project and that it's also supported by Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, it's currently not clear if the flaw has any impact beyond Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Security researchers are documenting a new vulnerability found in the util-linux core utilities package in Linux systems, warnign that it allows attackers to leak user passwords and modify the clipboard. The security defect, tracked as CVE-2024-28085 and dubbed \u2018WallEscape\u2019, impacts the \u2018wall\u2019 command of util-linux that fails to filter escape sequences from command line arguments. An attacker could embed escape sequences into crafted messages and send them via the \u2018wall\u2019 command, allowing them to leak passwords and modify commands, if specific conditions are met. \u201cThis allows unprivileged users to put arbitrary text on other users\u2019 terminals, if mesg is set to y and wall is setgid,\u201d said security researcher Skyler Ferrante.Ferrante, who is credited with discovering the flaw, said the bug can be exploited to leak user passwords on Ubuntu 22.04 with default configurations, where \u2018wall\u2019 is installed with the special setgid permissions and mesg is set to y. Debian Bookworm is also affected, but CentOS and Red Hat products are not. According to Ferrante, the flaw can also leak an unknown command on Ubuntu 22.0 \u201cif a system runs a command when commands are not found, with the unknown command as an argument.\u201d In addition, it can be exploited to change the output of any command.
