Example 1:

'CTI': A new variant of the infamous Gh0st RAT malware has been identified in recent attacks targeting South Koreans and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Uzbekistan. The Chinese group C.Rufus Security Team first released Gh0st RAT on the open Web in March 2008. Remarkably, it's still in use today, particularly in and around China, albeit in modified forms. Since late August, for instance, a group with strong Chinese links has been distributing a modified Gh0st RAT deemed SugarGh0st RAT. According to research from Cisco Talos, this threat actor drops the variant via JavaScript-laced Windows shortcuts, while distracting targets with customized decoy documents. The four samples of SugarGh0st, likely delivered via phishing, arrive on targeted machines as archives embedded with Windows LNK shortcut files. The LNKs hide malicious JavaScript which, upon opening, drops a decoy document - targeted for Korean or Uzbek government audiences - and the payload. Like its progenitor - the Chinese origin remote access Trojan, first released to the public in March 2008 - SugarGh0st is a clean, multitooled espionage machine. A 32-bit dynamic link library (DLL) written in C++, it begins by collecting system data, then opens up the door to full remote access capabilities. Attackers can use SugarGh0st to retrieve any information they might desire about their compromised machine, or start, terminate, or delete the processes it's running. They can use it to find, exfiltrate, and delete files, and erase any event logs to mask the resulting forensic evidence. The backdoor comes fitted with a keylogger, a screenshotter, a means of accessing the device's camera, and plenty of other useful functions for manipulating the mouse, performing native Windows operation, or simply running arbitrary commands.

Example 2:

'CTI': In an interview in January 2023, threat actors behind TargetCompany clarified that each major update of the ransomware entailed a change in the encryption algorithm and different decryptor characteristics. These are accompanied by a change in file name extensions, hence the evolution of names by which the ransomware group is known. We will discuss this evolution further in our blog entry. TargetCompany's earlier variants provided a \u201c.onion\u201d contact site for negotiations and dropped ransom notes named How to decrypt files.txt. Meanwhile, later variants of the TargetCompany ransomware no longer use the name of the targeted enterprise as file name extensions. In mid- to late 2022, the group was given the name\u202fFargo due to the extension that it added to its encrypted files in that period. Other extensions used by the ransomware group include \u201c.mallox,\u201d and \u201c.xollam.\u201d These later variants were observed using a combination of Chacha20, Curve 25519, and AES-128 algorithms to encrypt the victim's files. The ransomware group eventually established a data leak site under the name Mallox, and later variants dropped ransom notes as HOW TO RECOVER!!.txt.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Microsoft researchers have linked an emerging ransomware threat that already has compromised a number of small-to-mid-sized businesses to financially motivated North Korean state-sponsored actors that have been active since last year. A group tracked by researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) as DEV-0530 but that calls itself H0lyGh0st has been developing and using ransomware in attacks since June 2021. H0lyGh0st\u2019s standard modus operandi is to use a namesake ransomware to encrypt all files on the target device using the file extension .h0lyenc, then send the victim a sample of the files as proof. The group interacts with victims on a .onion site that it maintains and on which it provides a contact form for victims to get in touch, researchers said.
