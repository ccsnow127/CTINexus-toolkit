        "text": "At least four separate cyberattack groups have used a former zero-day security vulnerability in the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens from government organizations globally.ZCS is an email server, calendaring, and chat and video platform, used by thousands of companies and hundreds of millions of individuals, according to the Zimbra website. Its client organizations are as diverse as the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Germany's Max Planck Institute, and Gunung Sewu, a top business incubator in Southeast Asia. The bug (CVE-2023-37580) is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Zimbra email server that was patched on July 25, with a hotfix rolling out to its public GitHub repository on July 5. According to a report by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) shared with Dark Reading, the zero-day exploitation started in June, before Zimbra offered remediation.",
