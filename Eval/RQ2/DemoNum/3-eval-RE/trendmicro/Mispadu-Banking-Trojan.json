Mispadu malware steals credentials from users' systems. This attack targets systems with Spanish and Portuguese as system languages. It is also likely that they have targets similar to previous Mispadu attacks where users from Mexico, Spain, Portugal, and other nearby regions were targeted. This behavior is in line with past Mispadu schemes, such as the one where spam emails for fake discount coupons were used as bait.",
