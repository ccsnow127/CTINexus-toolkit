        "text": "PurpleFox (or 'DirtyMoe') is a modular Windows botnet malware first spotted in 2018 that comes with a rootkit module allowing it to hide and persist between device reboots. It can be used as a downloader that introduces more potent second-stage payloads on compromised systems, offers its operators backdoor capabilities, and can also act as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot. In October 2021, researchers noticed that new versions of PurpleFox switched to using WebSocket for command and control (C2) communications for stealth. In January 2022, a campaign spread the malware under the guise of a Telegram desktop app. CERT-UA used IoCs shared by Avast and TrendMicro to identify PurpleFox malware infections on Ukrainian computers, tracking the activity under the identifier 'UAC-0027'. CERT-UA says PurpleFox typically infects systems when victims launch laced MSI installers and highlights its self-propagation capabilities using exploits for known flaws and password brute-forcing.",
