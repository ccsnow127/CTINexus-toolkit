Example 1:

'CTI': Conti can arrive in the system through BazarLoader, which is delivered via phishing emails containing a Google Drive link that downloads the malware.Alternatively, the ransomware can arrive via exploiting the the FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2018-13374. After successfully exploiting the application, the ransomware deploys Cobalt Strike to gain a foothold on the system. Conti can also arrive as a result of the exploitation of the ProxyShell Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. The Conti group uses tools such as Whoami, Nltest, and Net. These tools give the operators information about where they are in the system, and what rights and permissions they have. Since the operators employ double extortion tactics, they actively look for files to exfiltrate in the discovery stage. The threat actors use tools such as ShareFinder to identify the shares needed for exfiltration and ransomware deployment. Although the group mostly relies on finding the domain admin credentials to gain full access to the domain, they may also use a couple of exploits like Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) and PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675), to elevate their privilege and further strengthen their foothold in the network.

Example 2:

'CTI': Exploit code is now available for a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT (Managed File Transfer) software that allows attackers to create new admin users on unpatched instances via the administration portal. GoAnywhere MFT is a web-based managed file transfer tool that helps organizations transfer files securely with partners and keep audit logs of who accessed all shared files. Today, almost seven weeks later, security researchers with Horizon3's Attack Team published a technical analysis of the vulnerability and shared a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that helps create new admin users on vulnerable GoAnywhere MFT instances exposed online. Their exploit takes advantage of the path traversal issue at the root of CVE-2024-0204 to access the vulnerable /InitialAccountSetup.xhtml endpoint and start the initial account setup screen to create a new administrator account.

Example 3:

'CTI': APT29, the notorious Russian advanced persistent threat behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, is actively exploiting a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity that could open the door to rampant software supply chain attacks.That's the word from CISA, the FBI, the NSA, and a host of international partners, who said in a joint alert today that APT29 (aka CozyBear, the Dukes, Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium) is hammering servers hosting TeamCity software at a large scale using the unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) bug. According to the feds, the exploitation of the issue, tracked as CVE-2023-42793 (CVSS score of 9.8), started in September after JetBrains patched the flaw and Rapid7 released a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for it; but now, it has grown to be a worrying global phenomenon that could result in widespread damage.

Example 4:

'CTI': A TeamCity vulnerability disclosed recently in controversial circumstances is being exploited in ransomware attacks, according to the product\u2019s developer and cybersecurity companies. On March 4, JetBrains, the developer of the TeamCity build management and continuous integration server, announced fixes for CVE-2024-27198 and CVE-2024-27199, two serious authentication bypass vulnerabilities. CVE-2024-27198, which has been rated critical, can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to take complete control of a server by creating a new admin user account or by generating an admin access token. Rapid7, whose researchers discovered the vulnerabilities, made public details of CVE-2024-27198 and CVE-2024-27199 a few hours after JetBrains announced fixes. Full disclosure seems to have occurred due to miscommunication between the two companies. Rapid7 was concerned that JetBrains would try to silently patch the vulnerabilities and the vendor was concerned that Rapid7 would disclose details too quickly. JetBrains informed customers about patches without notifying Rapid7, which decided to immediately This led to threat actors beginning to target CVE-2024-27198 shortly after disclosure on March 4. By March 6, LeakIX, a project that scans the web for vulnerable and misconfigured systems, started seeing mass exploitation, with signs of rogue user creation seen in 1,400 instances. GuidePoint Security reported on Friday that a ransomware group named BianLian, which has been known to target critical infrastructure, may have exploited CVE-2024-27198 for initial access.

Target report:

\"CTI\": More threat actors have started exploiting two recently resolved vulnerabilities in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote desktop access software. The issues, tracked as CVE-2024-1709 (CVSS score of 10) and CVE-2024-1708 (CVSS score of 8.4), are described as an authentication bypass flaw and a path traversal bug. ConnectWise disclosed the security defects on February 19, when it announced patches for them. Two days later, the company updated its advisory to warn of ongoing exploitation. \u201cEssentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance,\u201d the company notes in its advisory. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit targeting the flaws, collectively referred to as SlashAndGrab, was made public last week, and threat actors quickly started exploiting them for malware delivery. Now, Trend Micro says that more cybercrime groups have started exploiting the flaws, including the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware groups. Following initial access to vulnerable servers, Black Basta was seen performing reconnaissance, discovery, and elevation of privilege activities, and deploying Cobalt Strike payloads. In addition to searching for members of the \u2018domain admin\u2019 group, the attackers also added new accounts to the administrator group and deployed scripts to identify machines that recently connected to the Active Directory environment.
