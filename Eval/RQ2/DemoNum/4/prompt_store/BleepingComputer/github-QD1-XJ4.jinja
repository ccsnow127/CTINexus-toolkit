Example 1:

'CTI': A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-51467, resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-49070, CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month. CVE-2023-49070 refers to a pre-authenticated remote code execution flaw impacting versions prior to 18.12.10 that, when successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to gain full control over the server and siphon sensitive data. It is caused due to a deprecated XML-RPC component within Apache OFBiz. CVE-2023-51467 could be triggered using empty and invalid USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters in an HTTP request to return an authentication success message, effectively circumventing the protection and enabling a threat actor to access otherwise unauthorized internal resources.

Example 2:

'CTI': Google has released security updates to fix the first Chrome zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild since the start of the year. \u200bThe high-severity zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-0519) is due to a high-severity out-of-bounds memory access weakness in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which remote attackers can exploit via a crafted HTML page to gain access to data beyond the memory buffer through heap corruption, providing them access to sensitive information or triggering a crash. Besides unauthorized access to out-of-bounds memory, CVE-2024-0519 could also be exploited to bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR to make it easier to achieve code execution via another weakness.

Example 3:

'CTI': Security researchers are observing exploitation attempts for the CVE-2023-22527 remote code execution flaw vulnerability that affects outdated versions of Atlassian Confluence servers. The flaw has a critical severity score and is described as a template injection weakness that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server endpoints. The service says that attackers are trying out callbacks by executing the 'whoami' command to gather information about the level of access and privileges on the system.

Example 4:

'CTI': Mastodon, the free and open-source decentralized social networking platform, has fixed a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to impersonate and take over any remote account. The newly fixed flaw is tracked as CVE-2024-23832 and stems from insufficient origin validation in Mastodon, allowing attackers to impersonate users and take over their accounts. In July 2023, the Mastodon team fixed another critical bug tracked as CVE-2023-36460 and dubbed 'TootRoot,' which allowed attackers to send 'toots' (the equivalent of tweets) that would create web shells on target instances. Attackers could leverage this flaw to completely compromise Mastodon servers, allowing them to access sensitive user information, communications, and plant backdoors.

Target report:

\"CTI\": GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.
