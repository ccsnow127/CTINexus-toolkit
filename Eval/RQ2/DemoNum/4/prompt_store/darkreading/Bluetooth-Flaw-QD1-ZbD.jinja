Example 1:

'CTI': Researchers should be aware of threat actors repurposing older proof of concept (PoC) code to quickly craft a fake PoC for a newly released vulnerability. On Aug. 17, 2023, the Zero Day Initiative publicly reported a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in WinRAR tracked as CVE-2023-40477. They had disclosed it to the vendor on June 8, 2023. Four days after the public reporting of CVE-2023-40477, an actor using an alias of whalersplonk committed a fake PoC script to their GitHub repository. The fake PoC meant to exploit this WinRAR vulnerability was based on a publicly available PoC script that exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an application called GeoServer, which is tracked as CVE-2023-25157. We analyzed the fake PoC script and all the links in the infection chain, which ultimately installed a VenomRAT payload.

Example 2:

'CTI': The recent iOS 14.8 update fixes a zero-day, zero-click exploit for a vulnerability affecting every mobile iOS device. The flaw, dubbed FORCEDENTRY (CVE-2021-30860), resided in Apple's iMessage and, according to a report by The Citizen Lab, was used to push NSO Group's Pegasus spyware to mobile iOS devices dating back to as far as February 2021. Pegasus has been around for some years now but has been back in the spotlight recently following reports from both The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International about the spyware targeting journalists, activists, and others. One of the main concerns with FORCEDENTRY is that it can be used in what is called a zero-click attack, meaning it requires no user interaction. An attacker exploiting the flaw only needs the Apple ID of a device in order to silently compromise it

Example 3:

'CTI': A new vulnerability, which we refer to as \u201cMigraine\u201d for its involvement with macOS migration, could allow an attacker with root access to automatically bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS and perform arbitrary operations on a device. We shared these findings with Apple through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). A fix for this vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2023-32369, was included in the security updates released by Apple on May 18, 2023.

Example 4:

'CTI': A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-36884) affecting Microsoft Windows and Office products is being exploited by attackers in the wild. To date, the exploit has been used in highly targeted attacks against organizations in the government and defense sectors in Europe and North America. The vulnerability was disclosed yesterday (July 11) by Microsoft, which said that an attacker could create a specially crafted Microsoft Office document that enables remote code execution on the target's computer. In order for the exploit to succeed, the victim needs to open the malicious file. No patch has been released yet for the vulnerability.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Attackers can exploit a critical Bluetooth security vulnerability that's been lurking largely unnoticed for years on macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux device platforms. The keystroke injection vulnerability allows an attacker to control the targeted device as if they were attached by a Bluetooth keyboard, performing various functions remotely depending on the endpoint. Tracked as CVE-2023-45866, the flaw exists in how in the Bluetooth protocol is implemented on various platforms. It works by tricking the Bluetooth host state-machine into pairing with a fake keyboard without user confirmation. The vulnerability enables an attacker to pair an emulated Bluetooth keyboard with a victim's phone or computer, implementing the keyboard as a Python script that runs on a Linux computer. The attacker can then inject keystrokes, typing on the target device as if they were a Bluetooth keyboard legitimately attached to the target.
