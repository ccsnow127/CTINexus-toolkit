Example 1:

'CTI': Security researchers have spotted a recent increase in attacks involving a sophisticated new variant of Jupyter, an information stealer that has been targeting users of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers since at least 2020. The malware, also referred to as Yellow Cockatoo, Solarmarker, and Polazert, can backdoor machines and harvest a variety of credential information, including computer name, the user's admin privileges, cookies, Web data, browser password manager information, and other sensitive data from victim systems - such as logins for crypto-wallets and remote access apps. Researchers from VMware's Carbon Black managed detection and response (MDR) service recently observed the new version of the malware leveraging PowerShell command modifications and legitimate-looking, digitally signed payloads, infecting a steadily rising number of systems since late October. Morphisec and BlackBerry \u2014 two other vendors that have previously tracked Jupyter \u2014 have identified the malware as capable of functioning as a full-fledged backdoor. They have described its capabilities as including support for command and control (C2) communications, acting as a dropper and loader for other malware, hollowing shell code to evade detection, and executing PowerShell scripts and commands. BlackBerry has reported observing Jupyter also targeting crypto-wallets, such as Ethereum Wallet, MyMonero Wallet, and Atomic Wallet, in addition to accessing OpenVPN, Remote Desktop Protocol, and other remote access applications.

Example 2:

'CTI': PurpleFox (or 'DirtyMoe') is a modular Windows botnet malware first spotted in 2018 that comes with a rootkit module allowing it to hide and persist between device reboots. It can be used as a downloader that introduces more potent second-stage payloads on compromised systems, offers its operators backdoor capabilities, and can also act as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot. In October 2021, researchers noticed that new versions of PurpleFox switched to using WebSocket for command and control (C2) communications for stealth. In January 2022, a campaign spread the malware under the guise of a Telegram desktop app. CERT-UA used IoCs shared by Avast and TrendMicro to identify PurpleFox malware infections on Ukrainian computers, tracking the activity under the identifier 'UAC-0027'. CERT-UA says PurpleFox typically infects systems when victims launch laced MSI installers and highlights its self-propagation capabilities using exploits for known flaws and password brute-forcing.

Example 3:

'CTI': The prolific North Korean state-backed threat actor known as TA444 is back with shiny new malware for targeting macOS users, dubbed \"SpectralBlur.\" The custom tool is the latest in a string of proprietary malware that the advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been consistently generating \u2014 a trait that sets it apart from other DPRK-sponsored threats.According to Proofpoint threat researcher Greg Lesnewich, TA444 (aka APT38, BlueNoroff, BlackAlicanto, Coperenicum, Sapphire Sleet, and Stardust Chollima) debuted the SpectralBlur malware in August. It's a \"moderately capable backdoor, that can upload/download files, run a shell, update its configuration, delete files, hibernate, or sleep, based on commands issued from the [command-and-control server],\"

Example 4:

'CTI': The Android banking malware known as Vultur has been updated with new capabilities, allowing operators to interact with the infected devices and modify files, according to a report from security consulting outfit NCC Group. Vultur was first documented in March 2021, when it stood out for the abuse of the legitimate applications AlphaVNC and ngrok for remotely accessing the VNC server on the victim device, and for automating screen recording and key-logging for credential harvesting. The most recent version of the banking malware, however, packs significantly more capabilities, allowing attackers to control the infected device, prevent applications from running, display custom notifications, bypass lock-screen protections, and download, upload, install, search for, and delete files. The infection chain starts with a SMS message instructing the victim to call a phone number to resolve a large transaction that they did not authorize. During the call, a second SMS message that includes a link to a modified McAfee Security package is received. The modified application contains the functionality of the legitimate McAfee Security software, along with the dropper-framework called Brunhilda, which deploys Vultur via three payloads, the last two designed to invoke each other\u2019s functionality. \u201cThe message sent by the malware operator through FCM can contain a command, which, upon receipt, triggers the execution of corresponding functionality within the malware. This eliminates the need for an ongoing connection with the device,\u201d NCC Group explains. The latest version of Vultur can also prevent the user from interacting with applications on the device, which are defined in a list provided by the attacker.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A new Android backdoor has been discovered with potent capabilities to carry out a range of malicious actions on infected devices. Dubbed Xamalicious by the McAfee Mobile Research Team, the malware is so named for the fact that it's developed using an open-source mobile app framework called Xamarin and abuses the operating system's accessibility permissions to fulfill its objectives. It's also capable of gathering metadata about the compromised device and contacting a command-and-control (C2) server to fetch a second-stage payload, but only after determining if it fits the bill. The second stage is dynamically injected as an assembly DLL at runtime level to take full control of the device and potentially perform fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps, among other actions financially motivated without user consent. The cybersecurity firm said it identified 25 apps that come with this active threat, some of which were distributed on the official Google Play Store since mid-2020. The apps are estimated to have been installed at least 327,000 times.
