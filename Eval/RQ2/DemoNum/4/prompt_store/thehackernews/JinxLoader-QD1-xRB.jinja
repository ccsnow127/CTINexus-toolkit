Example 1:

'CTI': Unit 42 recently discovered a malware campaign targeting Portuguese speakers, which aims to redirect cryptocurrency away from legitimate users\u2019 wallets and into wallets controlled by threat actors instead. To do this, the campaign uses a type of malware known as a cryptocurrency clipper, which monitors the victim\u2019s clipboard for signs that a cryptocurrency wallet address is being copied. The malware, which we call CryptoClippy, seeks to replace the user\u2019s actual wallet address with the threat actor\u2019s, causing the user to inadvertently send cryptocurrency to the threat actor. Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting found victims across manufacturing, IT services, and real estate industries, though they likely impacted the personal wallet addresses of someone using their work machine. To deliver the malware to users\u2019 computers, threat actors in this campaign used both Google Ads and traffic distribution systems (TDS) to redirect victims to malicious domains that are impersonating the legitimate WhatsApp Web application. They use this to ensure victims are real users, and also that they\u2019re Portuguese speakers. For users who are sent to malicious domains, the threat attempts to trick them into downloading malicious files, including either .zip or .exe files, that lead to the final payload.

Example 2:

'CTI': Security researchers have spotted a recent increase in attacks involving a sophisticated new variant of Jupyter, an information stealer that has been targeting users of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers since at least 2020. The malware, also referred to as Yellow Cockatoo, Solarmarker, and Polazert, can backdoor machines and harvest a variety of credential information, including computer name, the user's admin privileges, cookies, Web data, browser password manager information, and other sensitive data from victim systems - such as logins for crypto-wallets and remote access apps. Researchers from VMware's Carbon Black managed detection and response (MDR) service recently observed the new version of the malware leveraging PowerShell command modifications and legitimate-looking, digitally signed payloads, infecting a steadily rising number of systems since late October. Morphisec and BlackBerry \u2014 two other vendors that have previously tracked Jupyter \u2014 have identified the malware as capable of functioning as a full-fledged backdoor. They have described its capabilities as including support for command and control (C2) communications, acting as a dropper and loader for other malware, hollowing shell code to evade detection, and executing PowerShell scripts and commands. BlackBerry has reported observing Jupyter also targeting crypto-wallets, such as Ethereum Wallet, MyMonero Wallet, and Atomic Wallet, in addition to accessing OpenVPN, Remote Desktop Protocol, and other remote access applications.

Example 3:

'CTI': The threat actor known as UAC-0050 is leveraging phishing attacks to distribute Remcos RAT using new strategies to evade detection from security software. The group's weapon of choice is Remcos RAT, a notorious malware for remote surveillance and control, which has been at the forefront of its espionage arsenal. However, in their latest operational twist, the UAC-0050 group has integrated a pipe method for interprocess communication, showcasing their advanced adaptability. UAC-0050, active since 2020, has a history of targeting Ukrainian and Polish entities via social engineering campaigns that impersonate legitimate organizations to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. In February 2023, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the adversary to a phishing campaign designed to deliver Remcos RAT.

Example 4:

'CTI': A new malware loader is being used by threat actors to deliver a wide range of information stealers such as Lumma Stealer (aka LummaC2), Vidar, RecordBreaker (aka Raccoon Stealer V2), and Rescoms. Cybersecurity firm ESET is tracking the trojan under the name Win/TrojanDownloader.Rugmi. This malware is a loader with three types of components: a downloader that downloads an encrypted payload, a loader that runs the payload from internal resources, and another loader that runs the payload from an external file on the disk. Telemetry data gathered by the company shows that detections for the Rugmi loader spiked in October and November 2023, surging from single digit daily numbers to hundreds per day. Stealer malware is typically sold under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model to other threat actors on a subscription basis. Lumma Stealer, for instance, is advertised in underground forums for $250 a month. The most expensive plan costs $20,000, but it also gives the customers access to the source code and the right to sell it.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A new Go-based malware loader called JinxLoader is being used by threat actors to deliver next-stage payloads such as Formbook and its successor XLoader. The malware pays homage to League of Legends character Jinx, featuring the character on its ad poster and [command-and-control] login panel. The attacks begin with phishing emails impersonating Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), urging recipients to open password-protected RAR archive attachments that, upon opening, drop the JinxLoader executable, which subsequently acts as a gateway for Formbook or XLoader. It also comes amid a surge in campaigns distributing DarkGate and PikaBot, along with a threat actor known as TA544 (aka Narwal Spider) leveraging new variants of loader malware called IDAT Loader to deploy Remcos RAT or SystemBC malware. What's more, the threat actors behind the Meduza Stealer have released an updated version of the malware (version 2.2) on the dark web with expanded support for browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and an improved credit card (CC) grabber.
