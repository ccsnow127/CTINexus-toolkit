Example 1:

'CTI': Nation-state actors affiliated to North Korea have been observed using spear-phishing attacks to deliver an assortment of backdoors and tools such as AppleSeed, Meterpreter, and TinyNuke to seize control of compromised machines. South Korea-based cybersecurity company AhnLab attributed the activity to an advanced persistent threat group known as Kimsuky. A notable point about attacks that use AppleSeed is that similar methods of attack have been used for many years with no significant changes to the malware that are used together. Kimsuky, active for over a decade, is known for its targeting of a wide range of entities in South Korea, before expanding its focus to include other geographies in 2017. It was sanctioned by the U.S. government late last month for amassing intelligence to support North Korea's strategic objectives. The threat actor's espionage campaigns are realized through spear-phishing attacks containing malicious lure documents that, upon opening, culminate in the deployment of various malware families.

Example 2:

'CTI': In June 2023, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit targeting Zimbra Collaboration, an email server many organizations use to host their email. Since discovering the 0-day, now patched as CVE-2023-37580, TAG has observed four different groups exploiting the same bug to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. Most of this activity occurred after the initial fix became public on Github. CVE-2023-37580 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a web application vulnerability that allows malicious scripts to be injected into another website. In this case, there was a vulnerability in Zimbra that injected the parameter within the URL directly into the webpage, causing the script to be executed.

Example 3:

'CTI': Last week Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in partnership with The Citizen Lab, discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit chain for iPhones. Developed by the commercial surveillance vendor, Intellexa, this exploit chain is used to install its Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device. In response, yesterday, Apple patched the bugs in iOS 16.7 and iOS 17.0.1 as CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. This quick patching from Apple helps to better protect users and we encourage all iOS users to install them as soon as possible.

Example 4:

'CTI': In January 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) publicly disclosed a campaign from government backed actors in North Korea who used 0-day exploits to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development. Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, finding 0-days and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign.

Target report:

\"CTI\": To protect our users, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) routinely hunts for 0-day vulnerabilities exploited in-the-wild. This blog will describe a 0-day vulnerability, discovered by TAG in late October 2022, embedded in malicious documents and used to target users in South Korea. We attribute this activity to a group of North Korean government-backed actors known as APT37. These malicious documents exploited an Internet Explorer 0-day vulnerability in the JScript engine, CVE-2022-41128. Our policy is to quickly report vulnerabilities to vendors, and within a few hours of discovering this 0-day, we reported it to Microsoft and patches were released to protect users from these attacks. This is not the first time APT37 has used Internet Explorer 0-day exploits to target users. The group has historically focused their targeting on South Korean users, North Korean defectors, policy makers, journalists and human rights activists.
