The 0-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-51467) in Apache OFBiz, disclosed on Dec. 26, allows an attacker to access sensitive information and remotely execute code against applications using the ERP framework, according to an analysis by cybersecurity firm SonicWall. The Apache Software Foundation had originally released a patch for a related issue, CVE-2023-49070, but the fix failed to protect against other variations of the attack.",
