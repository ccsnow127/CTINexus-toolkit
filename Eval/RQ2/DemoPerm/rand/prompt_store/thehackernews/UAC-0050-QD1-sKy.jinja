Example 1:

'CTI': A new vulnerability, which we refer to as \u201cMigraine\u201d for its involvement with macOS migration, could allow an attacker with root access to automatically bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS and perform arbitrary operations on a device. We shared these findings with Apple through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). A fix for this vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2023-32369, was included in the security updates released by Apple on May 18, 2023.

---------------------
Example 2:

'CTI': The recent iOS 14.8 update fixes a zero-day, zero-click exploit for a vulnerability affecting every mobile iOS device. The flaw, dubbed FORCEDENTRY (CVE-2021-30860), resided in Apple's iMessage and, according to a report by The Citizen Lab, was used to push NSO Group's Pegasus spyware to mobile iOS devices dating back to as far as February 2021. Pegasus has been around for some years now but has been back in the spotlight recently following reports from both The Citizen Lab and Amnesty International about the spyware targeting journalists, activists, and others. One of the main concerns with FORCEDENTRY is that it can be used in what is called a zero-click attack, meaning it requires no user interaction. An attacker exploiting the flaw only needs the Apple ID of a device in order to silently compromise it

Target report:

\"CTI\": The threat actor known as UAC-0050 is leveraging phishing attacks to distribute Remcos RAT using new strategies to evade detection from security software. The group's weapon of choice is Remcos RAT, a notorious malware for remote surveillance and control, which has been at the forefront of its espionage arsenal. However, in their latest operational twist, the UAC-0050 group has integrated a pipe method for interprocess communication, showcasing their advanced adaptability. UAC-0050, active since 2020, has a history of targeting Ukrainian and Polish entities via social engineering campaigns that impersonate legitimate organizations to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. In February 2023, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the adversary to a phishing campaign designed to deliver Remcos RAT.
