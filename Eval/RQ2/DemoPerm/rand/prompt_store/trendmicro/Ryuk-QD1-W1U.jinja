Example 1:

'CTI': Log4j has been making headlines recently after the public disclosure of three critical vulnerabilities in the utility which can lead to remote code execution (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) and denial of service (CVE-2021-45105). The initial remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been dubbed Log4Shell and has dominated cyber-security news ever since it was publicly disclosed on December 9. The vulnerability has been exploited to deploy a plethora of payloads like coin miners, Dridex malware, and even ransomware such as Conti.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Trigona ransomware is also linked to BlackCat (also known as AlphaVM, AlphaV, or ALPHV); however, there are currently no known similarities between the two groups. It is possible that BlackCat only utilized or collaborated with the threat actors deploying Trigona. A report by Arete confirmed that Trigona had been observed exploiting CVE-2021-40539 for initial access.\u202fOnce it takes hold of a victim's system and data, threat actors behind Trigona then provide an authorization key for victims to register to the negotiation portal. Trigona published critical data stolen from victims such as documents and contracts on their leak site. The website featured bidding options to acquire access to the leaked data and contained a countdown timer, which could have served to place more pressure on victims to pay up.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Starting this year, Ryuk began using another dropper called BazarLoader (also known as BazarBackdoor). Like Trickbot, BazarLoader is also primarily distributed via phishing emails that contain either malicious attachments or links to websites (typically free, online file-hosting solutions) that host malware. These phishing emails use normal social engineering techniques: For example, they are usually disguised as business correspondence or other important messages. Once the payload is distributed, a command-and-control (C&C) server is used to deploy and install the backdoor. According to the advisory, the threat actor behind TrickBot is also connected to BazarLoader.
