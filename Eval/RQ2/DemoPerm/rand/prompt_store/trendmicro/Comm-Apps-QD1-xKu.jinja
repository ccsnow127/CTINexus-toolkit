Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': We discovered a recent WhatsApp phishing campaign through our telemetry that led to banking trojan activity. In this campaign, the attacker shares a malicious APK file through WhatsApp with a message asking users to enter sensitive information in the app. The widely circulated fake banking message states \u201cYour [redacted] BANK Account will be Blocked Today please update your PANCARD immediately open [redacted]-Bank.apk for update your PANCARD. Thank You.\u201d and includes a APK file named [redacted]-BANK[.]apk. Upon investigation, we discovered that the APK file was malicious and interacting with it installs a fraudulent application on the victim device. The installed app impersonates a legitimate bank located in India and disguises itself as the bank's official Know Your Customer (KYC) application to trick users into submitting their sensitive information, despite this particular banking organization not being affiliated with an official KYC-related app. This information is then sent to a command and control (C2) server, as well as to the attacker's hard-coded phone number used in SMS functionality.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft is urging users to patch a zero-day vulnerability dubbed Dogwalk that is actively being exploited in the wild. The bug (CVE-2022-34713) is tied to a Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool and allows a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system. The warning is part of a massive August Patch Tuesday update that included 121 flaws, 17 of which were critical and 101 carrying a Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating of Important. Microsoft states that CVE-2022-34713 is a \u201cvariant of\u201d Dogwalk, but different. Microsoft scored the vulnerability as Important and warns that the exploitation of the bug can only be preformed by an adversary with physical access to a vulnerable computer.

Target report:

\"CTI\": We found samples that show how malicious actors are using Discord as part of a campaign involving malicious spam emails that eventually end in an AveMaria or AgentTesla malware infection. We first observed the use of malicious spam to deliver these malware families in 2019 \u2014 however, the addition of Discord as part of its attack routine is relatively recent. The malicious emails are typically either postal delivery notifications or invoices with an included DHL or TNT-themed attachment. These emails come with embedded links \u2014 either in the images or the text \u2014 that point to a Discord URL with the following format: hxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/{ChannelID}/{AttachmentID}/example[.]exe. These URLs are used to host AveMaria and AgentTesla, which will then infect the users' machines once they click on the executable.
