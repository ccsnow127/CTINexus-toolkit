Example 1:

'CTI': Despite first being detected six years ago, malicious attackers continue to use the Magniber ransomware to compromise organizations. In October 2022, phishing attacks were reported to distribute the Magniber ransomware using standalone JavaScript files digitally signed with a malformed key, exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2022-44698 to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security warnings, and allowing malicious files to be executed without raising alerts. Microsoft later patched this vulnerability in December 2022. Formerly known as a successor of Cerber, the Magniber ransomware was primarily distributed via the Magnitude exploit kit and exclusively targeted South Korea in 2017. In 2018, it expanded its targets across Asia using CVE-2018-8174 for initial access.

---------------------
Example 2:

'CTI': We have discovered an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that primarily targets online gambling sites. This group, which we have dubbed Earth Berberoka (aka GamblingPuppet), uses old yet upgraded malware families that have been attributed to Chinese-speaking actors, including PlugX and Gh0st RAT. It also uses a brand-new multistage malware family, which we have dubbed PuppetLoader. The malware families used by Earth Berberoka are multiplatform, targeting the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In an interview in January 2023, threat actors behind TargetCompany clarified that each major update of the ransomware entailed a change in the encryption algorithm and different decryptor characteristics. These are accompanied by a change in file name extensions, hence the evolution of names by which the ransomware group is known. We will discuss this evolution further in our blog entry. TargetCompany's earlier variants provided a \u201c.onion\u201d contact site for negotiations and dropped ransom notes named How to decrypt files.txt. Meanwhile, later variants of the TargetCompany ransomware no longer use the name of the targeted enterprise as file name extensions. In mid- to late 2022, the group was given the name\u202fFargo due to the extension that it added to its encrypted files in that period. Other extensions used by the ransomware group include \u201c.mallox,\u201d and \u201c.xollam.\u201d These later variants were observed using a combination of Chacha20, Curve 25519, and AES-128 algorithms to encrypt the victim's files. The ransomware group eventually established a data leak site under the name Mallox, and later variants dropped ransom notes as HOW TO RECOVER!!.txt.
