Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft has released a workaround for a zero-day flaw that was initially flagged in April and that attackers already have used to target organizations in Russia and Tibet, researchers said. The remote control execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-3019, is associated with the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), which, ironically, itself collects information about bugs in the company\u2019s products and reports to Microsoft Support. If successfully exploited, attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user\u2019s rights, the company said. A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word,\u201d Microsoft explained in its guidance on the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.

Example 2:

'CTI': Graphican is an evolution of the known Flea backdoor Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware \u2014 BS2005 \u2014 also used by Flea. Graphican has the same basic functionality as Ketrican, with the difference between them being Graphican's use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. This technique was used in a similar way by the Russian state-sponsored APT group Swallowtail (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Strontium) in a campaign in 2022 in which it delivered the Graphite malware. In that campaign, the Graphite malware used the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive as a C&C server. The observed Graphican samples did not have a hardcoded C&C server, rather they connected to OneDrive via the Microsoft Graph API to get the encrypted C&C server address from a child folder inside the Person folder. The malware then decoded the folder name and used it as a C&C server for the malware. All instances of this variant used the same parameters to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.

Target report:

\"CTI\": We have discovered an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that primarily targets online gambling sites. This group, which we have dubbed Earth Berberoka (aka GamblingPuppet), uses old yet upgraded malware families that have been attributed to Chinese-speaking actors, including PlugX and Gh0st RAT. It also uses a brand-new multistage malware family, which we have dubbed PuppetLoader. The malware families used by Earth Berberoka are multiplatform, targeting the Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.
