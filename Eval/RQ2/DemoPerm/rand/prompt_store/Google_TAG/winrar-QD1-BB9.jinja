Example 1:

'CTI': On July 11, 2023, Unit 42 cloud researchers discovered a new peer-to-peer (P2P) worm we call P2PInfect. Written in Rust, a highly scalable and cloud-friendly programming language, this worm is capable of cross-platform infections and targets Redis, a popular open-source database application that is heavily used within cloud environments. Redis instances can be run on both Linux and Windows operating systems. Unit 42 researchers have identified over 307,000 unique Redis systems communicating publicly over the last two weeks, of which 934 may be vulnerable to this P2P worm variant. While not all of the 307,000 Redis instances will be vulnerable, the worm will still target these systems and attempt the compromise. The P2PInfect worm infects vulnerable Redis instances by exploiting the Lua sandbox escape vulnerability, CVE-2022-0543. While the vulnerability was disclosed in 2022, its scope is not fully known at this point. However, it is rated in the NIST National Vulnerability Database with a Critical CVSS score of 10.0. Additionally, the fact that P2PInfect exploits Redis servers running on both Linux and Windows operating systems makes it more scalable and potent than other worms. The P2P worm observed by Unit 42 researchers serves as an example of a serious attack threat actors could conduct using this vulnerability.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft security researchers recently identified a campaign where attackers attempted to move laterally to a cloud environment through a SQL Server instance. This attack technique demonstrates an approach we've seen in other cloud services such as VMs and Kubernetes cluster, but not in SQL Server. The attackers initially exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an application within the target's environment. This allowed the attacker to gain access and elevated permissions on a Microsoft SQL Server instance deployed in Azure Virtual Machine (VM). The attackers then used the acquired elevated permission to attempt to move laterally to additional cloud resources by abusing the server's cloud identity. Cloud identities are commonly used in cloud services including SQL Server and may possess elevated permissions to carry out actions in the cloud. This attack highlights the need to properly secure cloud identities to defend SQL Server instances and cloud resources from unauthorized access.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In August 2023, RARLabs released an updated version of WinRAR that included fixes for several security-related bugs. One of those bugs, later assigned CVE-2023-38831, is a logical vulnerability within WinRAR causing extraneous temporary file expansion when processing crafted archives, combined with a quirk in the implementation of Windows\u2019 ShellExecute when attempting to open a file with an extension containing spaces. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file (such as an ordinary PNG file) within a ZIP archive. As detailed in a blog post from Group-IB, the vulnerability had been exploited as 0-day by cybercrime actors in-the-wild since at least April 2023 for campaigns targeting financial traders to deliver various commodity malware families. Hours after the blog post was released, proof of concepts and exploit generators were uploaded to public GitHub repositories.
