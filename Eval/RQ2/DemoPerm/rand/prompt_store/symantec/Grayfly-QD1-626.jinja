Example 1:

'CTI': APT29, the notorious Russian advanced persistent threat behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, is actively exploiting a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity that could open the door to rampant software supply chain attacks.That's the word from CISA, the FBI, the NSA, and a host of international partners, who said in a joint alert today that APT29 (aka CozyBear, the Dukes, Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium) is hammering servers hosting TeamCity software at a large scale using the unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) bug. According to the feds, the exploitation of the issue, tracked as CVE-2023-42793 (CVSS score of 9.8), started in September after JetBrains patched the flaw and Rapid7 released a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for it; but now, it has grown to be a worrying global phenomenon that could result in widespread damage.

Example 2:

'CTI': The notorious North Korean threat group known as Lazarus exploited a Windows zero-day vulnerability for privilege escalation in attacks involving a rootkit named FudModule, according to cybersecurity firm Avast. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-21338 and it was observed by Avast in Lazarus attacks last year. The security company developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit and sent it to Microsoft in August 2023. The flaw was patched by Microsoft with the company\u2019s February 2024 Patch Tuesday updates, but the initial advisory for CVE-2024-21338 did not list it as a zero-day. The vulnerability impacts the \u2018appid.sys\u2019 driver associated with Microsoft\u2019s AppLocker security feature. By targeting a vulnerability in a driver that is present on many systems \u2014 rather than using a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) approach \u2014 the attacker benefits from a higher degree of stealth. \u201cBy exploiting such a vulnerability, the attacker is in a sense living off the land with no need to bring, drop, or load any custom drivers, making it possible for a kernel attack to be truly fileless. This not only evades most detection mechanisms but also enables the attack on systems where driver allowlisting is in place,\u201d Avast explained. By exploiting CVE-2024-21338, Lazarus hackers were able to elevate their privileges on the compromised system and establish a kernel read/write primitive. This enabled them to perform direct kernel object manipulation in an updated version of the FudModule rootkit, which came to light in 2022.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Grayfly (aka GREF and Wicked Panda) is a targeted attack group that has been active since at least March 2017 using a custom backdoor known as Backdoor.Motnug (aka TOMMYGUN/CROSSWALK), a custom loader called Trojan.Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka Trojan.Agentemis), and ancillary tools in its attacks. Grayfly has been observed targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North America across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, and telecommunications. In more recent activity, Grayfly has continued with its focus on telecommunications but has also been observed targeting organizations operating within the media, finance, and IT service provider sectors. Typically Grayfly targets publicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading further within the network. Once a network has been compromised, Grayfly may install its custom backdoors onto additional systems. These tools allow the attackers to have comprehensive remote access to the network and proxy connections allowing them to access hard-to-reach segments of a target's network. Although sometimes labeled APT41, we consider Grayfly the espionage arm of APT41. Similarly, Symantec tracks other sub-groups of APT41 separately, such as Blackfly, its cyber-crime arm.
