Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report. Your response must be JSON and nothing else.

Example 1:

'CTI': Since February 2023, Microsoft has observed password spray activity against thousands of organizations carried out  by an actor we track as Peach Sandstorm (HOLMIUM). Peach Sandstorm is an Iranian nation-state threat actor who has recently pursued organizations in the satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors around the globe. Based upon the profile of victim organizations targeted and the observed follow-on intrusion activity, Microsoft assesses that this initial access campaign is likely used to facilitate intelligence collection in support of Iranian state interests. In cases where Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account, Microsoft observed the group using a combination of publicly available and custom tools for discovery, persistence, and lateral movement. In a small number of intrusions, Peach Sandstorm was observed exfiltrating data from the compromised environment.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft is urging users to patch a zero-day vulnerability dubbed Dogwalk that is actively being exploited in the wild. The bug (CVE-2022-34713) is tied to a Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool and allows a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system. The warning is part of a massive August Patch Tuesday update that included 121 flaws, 17 of which were critical and 101 carrying a Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating of Important. Microsoft states that CVE-2022-34713 is a \u201cvariant of\u201d Dogwalk, but different. Microsoft scored the vulnerability as Important and warns that the exploitation of the bug can only be preformed by an adversary with physical access to a vulnerable computer.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The Budworm advanced persistent threat (APT) group continues to actively develop its toolset. Most recently, the Threat Hunter Team in Symantec, part of Broadcom, discovered Budworm using an updated version of one of its key tools to target a Middle Eastern telecommunications organization and an Asian government. Both attacks occurred in August 2023. Budworm (aka LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27) deployed a previously unseen variant of its SysUpdate backdoor (SysUpdate DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll). SysUpdate is exclusively used by Budworm. As well as its custom malware, Budworm also used a variety of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in these attacks. It appears the activity by the group may have been stopped early in the attack chain as the only malicious activity seen on infected machines is credential harvesting.
