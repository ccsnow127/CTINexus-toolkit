Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': North Korean APT Lazarus is up to its old tricks with a cyberespionage campaign targeting engineers with a fake job posting that attempt to spread macOS malware. The malicious Mac executable used in the campaign targets both Apple and Intel chip-based systems. The campaign, identified by researchers from ESET Research Labs and revealed in a series of tweets posted Tuesday, impersonates cryptocurrency trader Coinbase in a job description claiming to seek an engineering manager for product security, researchers divulged. Dubbed Operation Interception, the recent campaign drops a signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase, which researchers discovered uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil. Malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon. It drops three files: a decoy PDF document Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf, a bundle http[://]FinderFontsUpdater[.]app and a downloader safarifontagent.\u201d

Example 2:

'CTI': A recently uncovered ransomware operation named 'Kasseika' has joined the club of threat actors that employs Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) tactics to disable antivirus software before encrypting files. Kasseika abuses the Martini driver (Martini.sys/viragt64.sys), part of TG Soft's VirtIT Agent System, to disable antivirus products protecting the targeted system. Kasseika attacks start with a phishing email sent to employees of the targeted organization, attempting to steal their account credentials, which will then be used for initial access to the corporate network. Next, Kasseika operators abuse the Windows PsExec tool to execute malicious .bat files on the infected system and others they have accessed through lateral movement. The batch file checks for the presence of a process named 'Martini.exe' and terminates it to avoid interference. Next, it downloads the vulnerable 'Martini.sys' driver on the machine. By using BYOVD attacks, aka exploiting flaws in the loaded driver, the malware gains the privileges to terminate 991 processes from a hardcoded list, many of which correspond to antivirus products, security tools, analysis tools, and system utilities.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Unit 42 researchers have investigated a series of destructive cyberattacks beginning in January 2023 and continuing as recently as October 2023, targeting the education and technology sectors in Israel. The attacks are characterized by attempts to steal sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property. Once the attackers stole the information, they deployed various wipers intended to cover the attackers' tracks and to render the infected endpoints unusable.
