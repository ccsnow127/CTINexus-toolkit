Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': A suspicious NuGet package designed to harvest data from industrial systems appears to be targeting developers who use technology from Chinese company Bozhon, ReversingLabs reports. Named SqzrFramework480 and published on the NuGet repository in January 2024, the package is a .NET library responsible for calibrating robotic movement settings, managing and creating GUIs, initializing and configuring machine vision libraries, and more.However, it can also harvest various types of information from different types of industrial systems, including cameras and robotic arms, can take screenshots, send ping packets, and open sockets for data transfer. \u201cNone of those behaviors are resolutely malicious. However, when taken together, they raise alarms. For example, we can assume that the screenshots that are being taken are sent to the remote server via the open socket. The ping serves as a heartbeat check to see if the exfiltration server is alive,\u201d ReversingLabs notes. The function that takes screenshots, which is not explicitly declared in the code, operates in a continuous loop if successful, capturing the primary screen every minute and sending the information to a remote IP address, via the opened socket.

Example 2:

'CTI': Unit 42 researchers have investigated a series of destructive cyberattacks beginning in January 2023 and continuing as recently as October 2023, targeting the education and technology sectors in Israel. The attacks are characterized by attempts to steal sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property. Once the attackers stole the information, they deployed various wipers intended to cover the attackers' tracks and to render the infected endpoints unusable.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A new vulnerability, which we refer to as \u201cMigraine\u201d for its involvement with macOS migration, could allow an attacker with root access to automatically bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS and perform arbitrary operations on a device. We shared these findings with Apple through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). A fix for this vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2023-32369, was included in the security updates released by Apple on May 18, 2023.
