Example 1:

'CTI': A novel multistage remote access trojan (RAT) that\u2019s been active since April 2020 is exploiting known vulnerabilities to target popular SOHO routers from Cisco Systems, Netgear, Asus and others. The malware, dubbed ZuoRAT, can access the local LAN, capture packets being transmitted on the device and stage man-in-the-middle attacks through DNS and HTTPS hijacking, according to researchers from Lumen Technologies\u2019 threat-intelligence arm Black Lotus Labs. The ability to not only hop on a LAN from a SOHO device and then stage further attacks suggests that the RAT may be the work of a state-sponsored actor.

Example 2:

'CTI': Apple is urging macOS, iPhone and iPad users immediately to install respective updates this week that includes fixes for two zero-days under active attack. The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices. Patches are available for effected devices running iOS 15.6.1 and macOS Monterey 12.5.1. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday. One of the flaws is a kernel bug (CVE-2022-32894), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an \u201cout-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.\u201d The vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it \u201cmay have been actively exploited.\u201d

Target report:

\"CTI\": More threat actors have started exploiting two recently resolved vulnerabilities in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote desktop access software. The issues, tracked as CVE-2024-1709 (CVSS score of 10) and CVE-2024-1708 (CVSS score of 8.4), are described as an authentication bypass flaw and a path traversal bug. ConnectWise disclosed the security defects on February 19, when it announced patches for them. Two days later, the company updated its advisory to warn of ongoing exploitation. \u201cEssentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance,\u201d the company notes in its advisory. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit targeting the flaws, collectively referred to as SlashAndGrab, was made public last week, and threat actors quickly started exploiting them for malware delivery. Now, Trend Micro says that more cybercrime groups have started exploiting the flaws, including the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware groups. Following initial access to vulnerable servers, Black Basta was seen performing reconnaissance, discovery, and elevation of privilege activities, and deploying Cobalt Strike payloads. In addition to searching for members of the \u2018domain admin\u2019 group, the attackers also added new accounts to the administrator group and deployed scripts to identify machines that recently connected to the Active Directory environment.
