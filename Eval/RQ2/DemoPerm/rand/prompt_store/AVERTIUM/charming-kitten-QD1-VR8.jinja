Example 1:

'CTI': The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-0324 is a financially motivated group known to gain initial access using email-based initial infection vectors and then hand off access to compromised networks to other threat actors. These handoffs frequently lead to ransomware deployment. Beginning in July 2023, Storm-0324 was observed distributing payloads using an open-source tool to send phishing lures through Microsoft Teams chats. This activity is not related to the Midnight Blizzard social engineering campaigns over Teams that we observed beginning in May 2023. Because Storm-0324 hands off access to other threat actors, identifying and remediating Storm-0324 activity can prevent more dangerous follow-on attacks like ransomware.Storm-0324 (DEV-0324), which overlaps with threat groups tracked by other researchers as TA543 and Sagrid, acts as a distributor in the cybercriminal economy, providing a service to distribute the payloads of other attackers through phishing and exploit kit vectors.  Storm-0324's tactics focus on highly evasive infection chains with payment and invoice lures. The actor is known to distribute the JSSLoader malware, which facilitates access for the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor Sangria Tempest (ELBRUS, Carbon Spider, FIN7). Previous distribution activity associated with Storm-0324 included the Gozi infostealer and the Nymaim downloader and locker.

Example 2:

'CTI': After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 - a temporary name given by the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S. The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via malicious advertisements. Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques. In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other ransomware operation's encryptors, such as BlackCat. By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United Kingdom's most popular racing circuits - Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed, but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal's ransomware is secure, its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups, Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files rather than using randomly generated extensions.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The Iranian advanced persistent threat actor and cyberespionage group, APT35, also known as Charming Kitten or Phosphorus, has been making headlines since 2014. During that time, the group launched one of the most sophisticated internet based spying campaigns organized by Iranian threat actors - a campaign conducted via social media. Since then, the group has not slowed down and has been responsible for several other cyber attacks around the world. In 2019, APT35 was responsible for targeting several academic institutions in the U.S, France, and the Middle East region. In late 2020, the group targeted medical research organizations in Israel and in the U.S. By 2021, APT35 was abusing Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities that were chained together (ProxyShell). As of 2022, APT35 has been observed using new tactics to attack a wide range of targets. Using a new strain of malware, the threat actors were able to use the malware for intelligence collection. The group has also been seen using a new tool called Hyperscrape to quietly extract emails from victim's mailboxes.
