Example 1:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 2:

'CTI': Researchers this week disclosed details on two security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Outlook that, when chained together, give attackers a way to execute arbitrary code on affected systems without any user interaction. Unusually, both of them can be triggered using a sound file. One of the flaws, tracked as CVE-2023-35384, is actually the second patch bypass that researchers at Akamai have uncovered for a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in Outlook that Microsoft first patched in March. The second flaw that Akamai disclosed this week (CVE-2023-36710) is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in a feature of Windows Media Foundation, and it has to do with how Windows parses sound files.

Target report:

\"CTI\": United States organizations within the financial sector are currently being attacked by a recently discovered ransomware operation named, Yanluowang. The ransomware operation is highly experienced with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and could be linked to veteran RaaS groups, Fivehands and Thieflock. Although the group is primarily focused on attacking organizations within the financial sector, they have also targeted companies in manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering. Let's take a look at Yanluowang's techniques, tactics, and how they may be connected to Fivehands and Thieflock. In October 2021, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, a division of Broadcom Software, discovered that Yanluowang ransomware was actively being used by a threat actor who was seen attacking U.S. corporations since at least August 2021. What was interesting about the attack was that many of the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used were previously used by ransomware threat actor, Thieflock. Most analysts assumed that the threat actor using Yanluowang must be an affiliate of Thieflock who shifted allegiances. Although Yanluowang attempted to attack a large organization in October 2021 by deploying ransomware, they were not successful due to the ransomware being somewhat underdeveloped. According to Symantec, their Threat Hunter Team initially discovered the use of AdFind, a legitimate command-line Active Directory query tool, on the undisclosed target's network. Ransomware attackers often use AdFind as a reconnaissance tool. The tool also equipped attackers with resources that they needed for lateral movement by way of Active Directory. Days after discovering the suspicious use of AdFind, attackers attempted to deploy Yanluowang ransomware.
