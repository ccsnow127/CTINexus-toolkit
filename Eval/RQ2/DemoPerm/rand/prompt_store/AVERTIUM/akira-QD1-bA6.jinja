Extracted information should follow the format of {\"subject\": ..., \"relation\": \"...\", \"object\": \"...\"}. Not all information is useful, useful information includes: threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware. Don't extract any time-related information. I have provided 2 examples, read the examples and learn how to extract useful information. At the end, you should extract triplets from the Target report.

Example 1:

'CTI': First observed in mid-November 2021 by researchers from the MalwareHunterTeam, BlackCat (aka AlphaVM, AlphaV, or ALPHV) swiftly gained notoriety for being the first major professional ransomware family to be written in Rust, a cross-platform language that enables malicious actors to customize malware with ease for different operating systems like Windows and Linux, thus affording a wide range of enterprise environments. Since then, BlackCat ransomware has frequently made the headlines for its successive attacks on high-profile targets and its use of triple extortion which has endowed the group with a distinct competitive edge over other RaaS operators. Aside from exposing exfiltrated data, ransomware actors that use triple extortion threaten to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their victims' infrastructure to coerce them to pay the ransom.

---------------------
Example 2:

'CTI': In November 2021, security researchers detected malicious activity by Clop operators that exploited a SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability to breach corporate networks and deliver the Clop ransomware as a payload. The Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-35211, allowed RCE on the vulnerable server with elevated privileges. A maritime services giant with headquarters in Singapore also fell prey to Clop. In November 2021, it was reported that Clop breached its IT systems to steal classified proprietary commercial information and employee data that included bank account details, payroll information, passports, email addresses, and internal correspondence, among others. In October 2022, Microsoft Security reported that DEV-0950, a ransomware group that appears to be associated with the cybercriminal group FIN11 (aka TA505), distributed Clop in a campaign that targeted one of the victims of the Raspberry Robin worm.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.
