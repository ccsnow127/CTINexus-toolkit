Example 1:

'CTI': A TeamCity vulnerability disclosed recently in controversial circumstances is being exploited in ransomware attacks, according to the product\u2019s developer and cybersecurity companies. On March 4, JetBrains, the developer of the TeamCity build management and continuous integration server, announced fixes for CVE-2024-27198 and CVE-2024-27199, two serious authentication bypass vulnerabilities. CVE-2024-27198, which has been rated critical, can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to take complete control of a server by creating a new admin user account or by generating an admin access token. Rapid7, whose researchers discovered the vulnerabilities, made public details of CVE-2024-27198 and CVE-2024-27199 a few hours after JetBrains announced fixes. Full disclosure seems to have occurred due to miscommunication between the two companies. Rapid7 was concerned that JetBrains would try to silently patch the vulnerabilities and the vendor was concerned that Rapid7 would disclose details too quickly. JetBrains informed customers about patches without notifying Rapid7, which decided to immediately This led to threat actors beginning to target CVE-2024-27198 shortly after disclosure on March 4. By March 6, LeakIX, a project that scans the web for vulnerable and misconfigured systems, started seeing mass exploitation, with signs of rogue user creation seen in 1,400 instances. GuidePoint Security reported on Friday that a ransomware group named BianLian, which has been known to target critical infrastructure, may have exploited CVE-2024-27198 for initial access.

Example 2:

'CTI': In May 2023, Kroll Cyber Threat Intelligence analysts published their discoveries of a new ransomware variant referred to as CACTUS, which has been actively targeting large commercial entities since March 2023. The name CACTUS is derived from the filename found within the ransom note, cAcTuS.readme.txt, and is also self-declared within the note. Encrypted files carry the extension .cts1, although variations in the appended number have been observed across different incidents and victims. CACTUS uses a unique tactic by requiring a key for decrypting the binary, likely implemented to evade antivirus detection. This key is embedded within a file named ntuser.dat, loaded through a scheduled task. Kroll's research noted instances of data exfiltration and victim extortion over Tox, a peer-to-peer messaging service, but no known victim leak site was identified.In its operations, CACTUS demonstrates a consistent set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The initial exploit involves the exploitation of vulnerable VPN appliances, a prevalent method observed across multiple CACTUS incidents. Once inside the network, the threat actor conducts internal scouting using tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner and PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints, identify user accounts, and ping remote endpoints. To maintain persistence, CACTUS deploys various remote access methods, including legitimate tools like Splashtop, AnyDesk, and SuperOps RMM, along with malicious tools like Cobalt Strike and Chisel. The threat actor attempts to disable security software using custom scripts, such as TotalExec, and uninstall common antivirus software.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A novel multistage remote access trojan (RAT) that\u2019s been active since April 2020 is exploiting known vulnerabilities to target popular SOHO routers from Cisco Systems, Netgear, Asus and others. The malware, dubbed ZuoRAT, can access the local LAN, capture packets being transmitted on the device and stage man-in-the-middle attacks through DNS and HTTPS hijacking, according to researchers from Lumen Technologies\u2019 threat-intelligence arm Black Lotus Labs. The ability to not only hop on a LAN from a SOHO device and then stage further attacks suggests that the RAT may be the work of a state-sponsored actor.
