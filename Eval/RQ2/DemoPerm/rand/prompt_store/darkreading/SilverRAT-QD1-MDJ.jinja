Example 1:

'CTI': A financially motivated threat actor has been targeting one-day vulnerabilities in public-facing services to deploy Linux backdoors, Check Point reports. Tracked as Magnet Goblin, the adversary was seen quickly adopting one-day vulnerabilities, often in edge devices, and relying on the Nerbian custom malware family to perform nefarious activities. Magnet Goblin was seen targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Ivanti VPNs (CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, CVE-2024-21888, and CVE-2024-21893), Magento (CVE-2022-24086), Qlik Sense (CVE-2023-41265, CVE-2023-41266, and CVE-2023-48365), and possibly Apache ActiveMQ. As part of an attack exploiting the recent Ivanti flaws, the threat actor was observed deploying a JavaScript credential stealer called Warpwire, a Linux variant of the NerbianRAT backdoor, and the open source tunneling tool Ligolo. The Warpwire stealer was previously linked to the mass exploitation of Ivanti vulnerabilities, suggesting that multiple threat actors might be using it, Check Point says. The tool was also seen in a 2022 attack against Magento servers, which were used as command-and-control (C&C) servers for the Windows variant of NerbianRAT and for Warpwire. Magnet Goblin deployed MiniNerbian, a smaller version of the Linux NerbianRAT backdoor, on the compromised Magento instances.

Example 2:

'CTI': To protect our users, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) routinely hunts for 0-day vulnerabilities exploited in-the-wild. This blog will describe a 0-day vulnerability, discovered by TAG in late October 2022, embedded in malicious documents and used to target users in South Korea. We attribute this activity to a group of North Korean government-backed actors known as APT37. These malicious documents exploited an Internet Explorer 0-day vulnerability in the JScript engine, CVE-2022-41128. Our policy is to quickly report vulnerabilities to vendors, and within a few hours of discovering this 0-day, we reported it to Microsoft and patches were released to protect users from these attacks. This is not the first time APT37 has used Internet Explorer 0-day exploits to target users. The group has historically focused their targeting on South Korean users, North Korean defectors, policy makers, journalists and human rights activists.

Target report:

\"CTI\": SilverRAT shows that the region's cybercriminal groups are becoming more sophisticated, according to Cyfirma's analysis. The first version of SilverRAT, whose source code was leaked by unknown actors in October, consists of a builder that allows the user to construct a remote access Trojan with specific features. The more interesting features, according to Cyfirma's analysis, include using either an IP address or webpage for command and control, bypasses for antivirus software, the ability to erase system restore points, and the delayed execution of payloads. At least two threat actors \u2014 one using the handle \"Dangerous silver\" and a second using \"Monstermc\" \u2014 are the developers behind both SilverRAT and a previous program, S500 RAT, according to Cyfirma's analysis. The hackers operate on Telegram and through online forums where they sell malware-as-a-service, distribute cracked RATs from other developers, and offer a variety of other services. In addition, they have a blog and website called Anonymous Arabic.
