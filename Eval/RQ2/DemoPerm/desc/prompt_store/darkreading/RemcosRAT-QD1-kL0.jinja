Example 1:

'CTI': The threat actor known as UAC-0050 is leveraging phishing attacks to distribute Remcos RAT using new strategies to evade detection from security software. The group's weapon of choice is Remcos RAT, a notorious malware for remote surveillance and control, which has been at the forefront of its espionage arsenal. However, in their latest operational twist, the UAC-0050 group has integrated a pipe method for interprocess communication, showcasing their advanced adaptability. UAC-0050, active since 2020, has a history of targeting Ukrainian and Polish entities via social engineering campaigns that impersonate legitimate organizations to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments. In February 2023, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) attributed the adversary to a phishing campaign designed to deliver Remcos RAT.

Example 2:

'CTI': Follina (CVE-2022-30190) is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that allows remote code execution on vulnerable systems through the ms-msdt protocol handler scheme. The bug is present in all supported versions of Windows. The vulnerability can be easily exploited by a specially crafted Word document that downloads and loads a malicious HTML file through Word's remote template feature. The HTML file ultimately allows the attacker to load and execute PowerShell code within Windows. The vulnerability can also be exploited through the RTF file format.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A threat actor known for repeatedly targeting organizations in Ukraine with the RemcosRAT remote surveillance and control tool is back at it again, this time with a new tactic for transferring data without triggering endpoint detection and response systems. The adversary, tracked as UNC-0050, is focused on Ukrainian government entities in its latest campaign. Researchers at Uptycs who spotted it said the attacks may be politically motivated, with the goal of collecting specific intelligence from Ukrainian government agencies. While the possibility of state sponsorship remains speculative, the group's activities pose an undeniable risk, especially to government sectors reliant on Windows systems,
