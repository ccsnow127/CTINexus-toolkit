"Example 1:

"Context": "Cuba ransomware first appeared in 2019 but remained relatively unnoticed until November 2021, when they reportedly targeted a minimum of 49 organizations across various sectors. The sectors included government, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and finance. During this time, Cuba ransomware operators were infiltrating networks by encrypting files using the '.cuba' extension. Over the years, the ransom demands from Cuba totals at least $145 million, and the group has successfully collected at least $60 million in ransom payments. By 2022, the threat actors had expanded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), leading security researchers to suggest a potential connection between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors. This month, Cuba garnered attention when they took responsibility for a cyberattack on The Philadelphia Inquirer."

Example 2:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

Target task:

"Context": Microsoft is urging users to patch a zero-day vulnerability dubbed Dogwalk that is actively being exploited in the wild. The bug (CVE-2022-34713) is tied to a Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool and allows a remote attacker to execute code on a vulnerable system. The warning is part of a massive August Patch Tuesday update that included 121 flaws, 17 of which were critical and 101 carrying a Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating of Important. Microsoft states that CVE-2022-34713 is a \u201cvariant of\u201d Dogwalk, but different. Microsoft scored the vulnerability as Important and warns that the exploitation of the bug can only be preformed by an adversary with physical access to a vulnerable computer.
