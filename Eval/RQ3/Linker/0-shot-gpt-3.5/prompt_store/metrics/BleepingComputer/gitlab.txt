""Context": Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "servers" and entity "CVE-2023-7028"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "servers" and entity "CVE-2023-7028", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
