""Context": BlackCat operators recently announced new updates to their tooling, including a utility called Munchkin that allows attackers to propagate the BlackCat payload to remote machines and shares on a victim organization network. For the past two years, the BlackCat ransomware operators have continued to evolve and iterate their tooling as part of their ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model. As part of a recent investigation, Unit 42 researchers have acquired an instance of Munchkin that is unique, in that it is loaded in a customized Alpine virtual machine (VM). This new tactic of leveraging a customized VM to deploy malware has been gaining traction in recent months, allowing ransomware threat actors to use VMs to circumvent security solutions in deploying their malware payloads.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "BlackCat ransomware operators" and entity "Munchkin"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "BlackCat ransomware operators" and entity "Munchkin", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
