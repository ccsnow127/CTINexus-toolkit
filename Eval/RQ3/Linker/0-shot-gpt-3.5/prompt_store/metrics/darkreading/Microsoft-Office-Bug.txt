""Context": Attackers are exploiting a 6-year-old Microsoft Office remote code execution (RCE) flaw to deliver spyware, in an email campaign weaponized by malicious Excel attachments and characterized by sophisticated evasion tactics. Threat actors dangle lures relating to business activity in spam emails that deliver files that contain CVE-2017-11882, an RCE flaw that dates back to 2014 and can allow for system takeover, Zscaler revealed in a blog post published Dec. 19. The end goal of the attack is to load Agent Tesla, a remote access Trojan (RAT) and advanced keylogger first discovered in 2014, and exfiltrate credentials and other data from an infected system via a Telegram bot run by the attackers.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "email campaign" and entity "Agent Tesla"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "email campaign" and entity "Agent Tesla", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
