""Context": Ransomware groups are abusing unpatched versions of a Linux-based Mitel VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) application and using it as a springboard plant malware on targeted systems. The critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-29499, was first report by Crowdstrike in April as a zero-day vulnerability and is now patched. Mitel is popularly known for providing business phone systems and unified communication as a service (UCaaS) to all forms of organizations. The Mitel focuses on VoIP technology allowing users to make phone calls using an internet connection instead of regular telephone lines.
