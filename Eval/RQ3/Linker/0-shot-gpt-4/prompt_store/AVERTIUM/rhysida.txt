""Context": Rhysida ransomware came to public attention in May 2023. The group has been associated with several significant breaches, including an attack on the Chilean Army where they leaked stolen documents on their data leak site. The threat actor was also linked to an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, impacting 17 hospitals and 166 clinics across the U.S. Following this attack, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HC3) classified Rhysida as a substantial threat to the healthcare sector. Rhysida typically gains access to a victim's system through phishing tactics, followed by the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the system. Additionally, the threat actors use PsExec to deploy both PowerShell scripts and the Rhysida ransomware payload. The PowerShell script, known as g.ps1 and identified as Trojan.PS1.SILENTKILL.A, serves various purposes for the threat actors, including terminating antivirus processes and services, erasing shadow copies, altering remote desktop protocol (RDP) configurations, and modifying the active directory (AD) password. Notably, during the execution of the script (g.ps1), it appears that the threat actors updated it, ultimately leading to a PowerShell version of Rhysida ransomware. Rhysida uses a 4096-bit RSA key and AES-CTR for file encryption. After successfully encrypting files, it appends the .rhysida extension to them and deposits a ransom note named CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "PowerShell script (g.ps1)" and entity "Rhysida ransomware"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "PowerShell script (g.ps1)" and entity "Rhysida ransomware", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
