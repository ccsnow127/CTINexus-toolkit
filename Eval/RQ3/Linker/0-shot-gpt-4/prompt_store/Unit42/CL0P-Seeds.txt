""Context": The CL0P ransomware group recently began using torrents to distribute victim data after a successful campaign stealing data from thousands of companies. We'll cover the reason for this shift in methodology and what this means for visibility to the outside world. CL0P has been one of the ransomware groups most actively posting data about their victims on leak sites tracked by Unit 42 (second only to LockBit in 2023). Unit 42 consultants have recently observed CL0P in about 10 incident response cases.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Unit 42" and entity "The CL0P ransomware group"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "Unit 42" and entity "The CL0P ransomware group", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
