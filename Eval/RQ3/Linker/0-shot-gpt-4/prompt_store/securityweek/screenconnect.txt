""Context": More threat actors have started exploiting two recently resolved vulnerabilities in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote desktop access software. The issues, tracked as CVE-2024-1709 (CVSS score of 10) and CVE-2024-1708 (CVSS score of 8.4), are described as an authentication bypass flaw and a path traversal bug. ConnectWise disclosed the security defects on February 19, when it announced patches for them. Two days later, the company updated its advisory to warn of ongoing exploitation. \u201cEssentially, a bad actor could mimic the role as system admin, delete all other users and take over the instance,\u201d the company notes in its advisory. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit targeting the flaws, collectively referred to as SlashAndGrab, was made public last week, and threat actors quickly started exploiting them for malware delivery. Now, Trend Micro says that more cybercrime groups have started exploiting the flaws, including the Black Basta and Bl00dy ransomware groups. Following initial access to vulnerable servers, Black Basta was seen performing reconnaissance, discovery, and elevation of privilege activities, and deploying Cobalt Strike payloads. In addition to searching for members of the \u2018domain admin\u2019 group, the attackers also added new accounts to the administrator group and deployed scripts to identify machines that recently connected to the Active Directory environment.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Black Basta" and entity "attackers"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "Black Basta" and entity "attackers", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
