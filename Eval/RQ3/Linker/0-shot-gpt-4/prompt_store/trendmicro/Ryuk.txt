""Context": Starting this year, Ryuk began using another dropper called BazarLoader (also known as BazarBackdoor). Like Trickbot, BazarLoader is also primarily distributed via phishing emails that contain either malicious attachments or links to websites (typically free, online file-hosting solutions) that host malware. These phishing emails use normal social engineering techniques: For example, they are usually disguised as business correspondence or other important messages. Once the payload is distributed, a command-and-control (C&C) server is used to deploy and install the backdoor. According to the advisory, the threat actor behind TrickBot is also connected to BazarLoader.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "deploy and install the backdoor" and entity "BazarLoader"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "deploy and install the backdoor" and entity "BazarLoader", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
