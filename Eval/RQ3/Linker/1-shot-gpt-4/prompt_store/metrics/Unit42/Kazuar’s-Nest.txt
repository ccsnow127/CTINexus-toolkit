Example:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Storm-0978/RomCom" and entity "CVE-2023-36884"

"predicted_triple": {"subject": "Storm-0978/RomCom", "relation": "actively exploited", "object": "CVE-2023-36884"}

Target task:

"Context": While tracking the evolution of Pensive Ursa (aka Turla, Uroburos), Unit 42 researchers came across a new, upgraded variant of Kazuar. Not only is Kazuar another name for the enormous and dangerous cassowary bird, Kazuar is an advanced and stealthy .NET backdoor that Pensive Ursa usually uses as a second stage payload. Pensive Ursa is a Russian-based threat group operating since at least 2004, which is linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The Ukrainian CERT reported in July 2023 that this version of Kazuar was targeting the Ukrainian defense sector. The threat group behind this variant was going after sensitive assets such as those found in Signal messages, source control and cloud platforms data. Since Unit 42's discovery of Kazuar in 2017, we have seen it in the wild only a handful of times, targeting mostly organizations in the European government and military sectors. The Sunburst backdoor has been tied to Kazuar by code resemblance, which demonstrates its complexity level. Since late 2020, we had not seen new Kazuar samples in the wild \u2013 yet reports suggested Kazuar was under constant development.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "sensitive assets" and entity "Kazuar"?
