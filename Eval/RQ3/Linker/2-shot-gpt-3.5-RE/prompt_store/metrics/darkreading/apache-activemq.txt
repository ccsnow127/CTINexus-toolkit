"Example 1:

"Context": "Cuba ransomware first appeared in 2019 but remained relatively unnoticed until November 2021, when they reportedly targeted a minimum of 49 organizations across various sectors. The sectors included government, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and finance. During this time, Cuba ransomware operators were infiltrating networks by encrypting files using the '.cuba' extension. Over the years, the ransom demands from Cuba totals at least $145 million, and the group has successfully collected at least $60 million in ransom payments. By 2022, the threat actors had expanded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), leading security researchers to suggest a potential connection between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors. This month, Cuba garnered attention when they took responsibility for a cyberattack on The Philadelphia Inquirer."

Example 2:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

Target task:

"Context": More than 3,000 Internet-accessible Apache ActiveMQ Servers are exposed to a critical remote code execution vulnerability that an attacker has begun actively targeting to drop ransomware. The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) disclosed the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-46604, on Oct. 27. The bug allows a remote attacker with access to an ActiveMQ message broker to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems. Proof-of-concept exploit code and full details of the vulnerability are publicly available, meaning that threat actors have both the means and the information to launch attacks against the vulnerability. Researchers at Rapid7 reported observing exploit activity targeting the flaw at two customer locations, starting the same day that ASF disclosed the threat. In both instances, the adversary attempted to deploy ransomware binaries on target systems in an effort to ransom the victim organizations. They described both targeted organizations as running outdated versions of Apache ActiveMQ. The researchers attributed the malicious activity to the HelloKitty ransomware family, based on the ransom note and other attack attributes. HelloKitty ransomware has been percolating in the wild since at least 2020. Its operators have tended to favor double-extortion attacks in which they have not just encrypted the data but also stolen it as additional leverage for extracting a ransom from victims. The HelloKitty ransomware attacks leveraging the ActiveMQ flaw appeared somewhat rudimentary. In one of the attacks, the threat actor made more than a half dozen attempts to encrypt the data, prompting the researchers to label to threat actor as 'clumsy' in their report.
