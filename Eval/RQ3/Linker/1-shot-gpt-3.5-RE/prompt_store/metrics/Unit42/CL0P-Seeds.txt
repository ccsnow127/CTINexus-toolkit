"Example:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Storm-0978/RomCom" and entity "CVE-2023-36884"

"predicted_triple": {"subject": "Storm-0978/RomCom", "relation": "actively exploited", "object": "CVE-2023-36884"}
---------------------
Target task:

"Context": The CL0P ransomware group recently began using torrents to distribute victim data after a successful campaign stealing data from thousands of companies. We'll cover the reason for this shift in methodology and what this means for visibility to the outside world. CL0P has been one of the ransomware groups most actively posting data about their victims on leak sites tracked by Unit 42 (second only to LockBit in 2023). Unit 42 consultants have recently observed CL0P in about 10 incident response cases.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Unit 42" and entity "The CL0P ransomware group"?

Your response must be JSON and nothing else. predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "Unit 42" and entity "The CL0P ransomware group", do not come up with new entity."
