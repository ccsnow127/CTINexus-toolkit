"Example:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "Storm-0978/RomCom" and entity "CVE-2023-36884"

"predicted_triple": {"subject": "Storm-0978/RomCom", "relation": "actively exploited", "object": "CVE-2023-36884"}
---------------------
Target task:

"Context": In June 2023, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit targeting Zimbra Collaboration, an email server many organizations use to host their email. Since discovering the 0-day, now patched as CVE-2023-37580, TAG has observed four different groups exploiting the same bug to steal email data, user credentials, and authentication tokens. Most of this activity occurred after the initial fix became public on Github. CVE-2023-37580 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a web application vulnerability that allows malicious scripts to be injected into another website. In this case, there was a vulnerability in Zimbra that injected the parameter within the URL directly into the webpage, causing the script to be executed. 

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "a vulnerability in Zimbra" and entity "an in-the-wild 0-day exploit"?

Your response must be JSON and nothing else. predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "a vulnerability in Zimbra" and entity "an in-the-wild 0-day exploit", do not come up with new entity."
