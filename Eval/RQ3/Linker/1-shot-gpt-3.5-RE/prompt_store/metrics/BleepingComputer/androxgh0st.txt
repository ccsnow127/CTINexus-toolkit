"Example:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

---------------------
Target task:

"Context": CISA and the FBI warned today that threat actors using Androxgh0st malware are building a botnet focused on cloud credential theft and using the stolen information to deliver additional malicious payloads. It scans for websites and servers vulnerable to the following remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-9841 (PHPUnit unit testing framework), CVE-2021-41773 (Apache HTTP Server), and CVE-2018-15133 (Laravel PHP web framework). Androxgh0st is a Python-scripted malware primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information, such as credentials for various high profile applications, i.e., Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework. Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning and exploiting exposed credentials and application programming interfaces (APIs), and web shell deployment. Stolen Twilio and SendGrid credentials can be used by the threat actors to conduct spam campaigns impersonating the breached companies.
