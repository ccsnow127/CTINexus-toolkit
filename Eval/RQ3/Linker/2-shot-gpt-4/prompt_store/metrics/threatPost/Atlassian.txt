Example 1:

"Context": "Cuba ransomware first appeared in 2019 but remained relatively unnoticed until November 2021, when they reportedly targeted a minimum of 49 organizations across various sectors. The sectors included government, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and finance. During this time, Cuba ransomware operators were infiltrating networks by encrypting files using the '.cuba' extension. Over the years, the ransom demands from Cuba totals at least $145 million, and the group has successfully collected at least $60 million in ransom payments. By 2022, the threat actors had expanded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), leading security researchers to suggest a potential connection between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors. This month, Cuba garnered attention when they took responsibility for a cyberattack on The Philadelphia Inquirer."

Example 2:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

Target task:

"Context": Threat actors are using public exploits to pummel a critical zero-day remote code execution (RCE) flaw that affects all versions of a popular collaboration tool used in cloud and hybrid server environments and allows for complete host takeover.Researchers from Volexity uncovered the flaw in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center software over the Memorial Day weekend after they detected suspicious activity on two internet-facing web servers belonging to a customer running the software, they said in a blog post published last week. The researchers tracked the activity to a public exploit for the vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, that\u2019s been spreading rapidly, and subsequently reported the flaw to Atlassian. As observed by Volexity researchers, what\u2019s being described as an \u201cOGNL injection vulnerability\u201d appears to allow for a Java Server Page (JSP) webshell to be written into a publicly accessible web directory on Confluence software.
