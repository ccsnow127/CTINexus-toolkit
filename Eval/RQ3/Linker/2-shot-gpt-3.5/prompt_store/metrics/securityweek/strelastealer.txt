Example 1:

"Context": "Cuba ransomware first appeared in 2019 but remained relatively unnoticed until November 2021, when they reportedly targeted a minimum of 49 organizations across various sectors. The sectors included government, healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and finance. During this time, Cuba ransomware operators were infiltrating networks by encrypting files using the '.cuba' extension. Over the years, the ransom demands from Cuba totals at least $145 million, and the group has successfully collected at least $60 million in ransom payments. By 2022, the threat actors had expanded their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), leading security researchers to suggest a potential connection between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors. This month, Cuba garnered attention when they took responsibility for a cyberattack on The Philadelphia Inquirer."

Example 2:

"Context": "CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations."

Target task:

"Context": Over 100 organizations in the US and EU have been targeted in recent large-scale phishing campaigns distributing the information stealer malware known as StrelaStealer, Palo Alto Networks reports. First documented in November 2022, StrelaStealer harvests credentials from the well-known email clients and sends them to an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C&C) server specified in the malware\u2019s configuration. Over the past five months, Palo Alto Networks identified multiple large-scale campaigns carrying attachments deploying the infostealer in the form of a malicious DLL.Following an initial wave of emails in November 2023, the attackers launched two more in January and February 2024, mostly targeting the same North American and European regions. Tailored to local languages, the spam messages were mainly sent to organizations in the high-tech sector, with entities across finance, professional and legal services, manufacturing, government, utilities and energy, insurance, and construction targeted as well. Unlike earlier StrelaStealer campaigns that featured ISO attachments containing LNK and HTML files designed to fetch the malware from a remote server, the recent attacks involved a ZIP attachment that contained a JScript file designed to drop the final payload in the form of a DLL.

"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "JScript file" and entity "Campaigns"?
