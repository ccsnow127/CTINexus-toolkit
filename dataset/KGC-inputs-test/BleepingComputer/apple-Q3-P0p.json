The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.",
