Example 1:

'CTI': A Chinese hacking group has been exploiting a critical vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) as a zero-day since at least late 2021. The flaw was patched in October, with VMware confirming this Wednesday that it's aware of CVE-2023-34048 in-the-wild exploitation, although it didn't share any other details on the attacks. However, as security firm Mandiant revealed today, the vulnerability was used by the UNC3886 Chinese cyber espionage group as part of a previously reported campaign, exposed in June 2023. The cyberspies used it to breach their targets' vCenter servers and compromised credentials to deploy VirtualPita and VirtualPie backdoors on ESXi hosts via maliciously crafted vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs). In the next stage, they exploited the CVE-2023-20867 VMware Tools authentication bypass flaw to escalate privileges, harvest files, and exfiltrate them from guest VMs.

Example 2:

'CTI': CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations.
