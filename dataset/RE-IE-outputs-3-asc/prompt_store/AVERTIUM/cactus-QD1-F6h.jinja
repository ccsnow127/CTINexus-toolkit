Example 1:

'CTI': Mallox ransomware specifically targets computers running Microsoft Windows. This ransomware was first observed in June 2021 and is known for exploiting unsecured MS-SQL servers as a penetration vector to compromise victims' networks. The ransomware's targeted industries are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. The ransomware operators claim that their victims include worldwide organizations. According to Lior Rochberger, a senior security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, Mallox's sudden increase in activity is attributed to the deliberate actions taken by the group's leaders to expand Mallox's operations. Rochberger stated that group appeared to focus more on recruiting affiliates at the beginning of 2023. This shift in strategy explains the significant increase observed this year. Recently, researchers from Unit 42 have noticed a significant increase in Mallox ransomware activity, with a surge of almost 174% compared to 2022. This increase is primarily due to Mallox using vulnerable MS-SQL (CVE-2020-0618 and CVE-2019-1068) servers to spread the ransomware. Unit 42 also observed Mallox using tactics such as brute force, data exfiltration, and the use of network scanning tools. Researchers have also reported that the group has attempted to distribute Mallox via phishing emails - suggesting affiliates may be involved. Once the threat actors gain access, they use the command line and PowerShell to download the Mallox ransomware payload from a remote server. Like other ransomware groups, the initial payload tries to deactivate any services that might hinder data encryption on the targeted system. Also, it tries to erase shadow copies, making data recovery more challenging after encryption. The malware also attempts to eliminate all event logs, utilizing a commonly used Microsoft command utility to try and complicate forensic analysis. Like CryptNet, the threat actors behind Mallox use the double extortion method - stealing data before encrypting it. They also have a data leak site where they leak the data of victims that refuse to pay or negotiate its ransom demands. Victims negotiate with the threat actors by using a private key to authenticate themselves. As previously stated, the ransomware operators claim to have breached hundreds of organizations worldwide. Unit 42 stated that their telemetry indicates at least dozens of potential Mallox victims. In 2022, Mallox ransomware was discovered to be a variant of the TargetCompany ransomware strain.

Example 2:

'CTI': This report is an overview of the FiveHands Ransomware variant that successfully attacked an organization (CISA release date May 6, 2021). CISA reports that the variant used publicly-available pen test and exploitation tools, plus FiveHands ransomware and SombRAT remote access trojan (RAT), to steal information, obfuscate files, accomplish network discovery, accomplish credential access, and demand ransom from the victim. Tools used include SoftPerfect Network Scanner, FiveHands ransomware, PsExec.exe, ServeManager.exe, SombRAT, RouterScan.exe, grabff.exe, rclone.exe, and s3browser-9-5-3.exe. The initial access vector was a zero-day vulnerability in a VPN product. What followed is that the bad actor used SoftPerfect Network Scanner for the discovery of hostnames and network services. PsExec was then used to execute ServeManager.exe (what CISA calls FiveHands ransomware). FiveHands is a novel ransomware variant that uses a public key encryption scheme called NTRUEncrypt. Note: the NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem encryption algorithm (NTRU), is a lattice-based alternative to Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, known as RSA, and Elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, and is based on the shortest vector problem in a lattice. To prevent data recovery, FiveHands uses WMI to first enumerate then delete Volume Shadow copies. The malware also encrypts files in the recovery folder. After the files are encrypted, the program will write a ransom note to each folder and directory on the system.

Example 3:

'CTI': Rhysida ransomware came to public attention in May 2023. The group has been associated with several significant breaches, including an attack on the Chilean Army where they leaked stolen documents on their data leak site. The threat actor was also linked to an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, impacting 17 hospitals and 166 clinics across the U.S. Following this attack, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HC3) classified Rhysida as a substantial threat to the healthcare sector. Rhysida typically gains access to a victim's system through phishing tactics, followed by the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the system. Additionally, the threat actors use PsExec to deploy both PowerShell scripts and the Rhysida ransomware payload. The PowerShell script, known as g.ps1 and identified as Trojan.PS1.SILENTKILL.A, serves various purposes for the threat actors, including terminating antivirus processes and services, erasing shadow copies, altering remote desktop protocol (RDP) configurations, and modifying the active directory (AD) password. Notably, during the execution of the script (g.ps1), it appears that the threat actors updated it, ultimately leading to a PowerShell version of Rhysida ransomware. Rhysida uses a 4096-bit RSA key and AES-CTR for file encryption. After successfully encrypting files, it appends the .rhysida extension to them and deposits a ransom note named CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In May 2023, Kroll Cyber Threat Intelligence analysts published their discoveries of a new ransomware variant referred to as CACTUS, which has been actively targeting large commercial entities since March 2023. The name CACTUS is derived from the filename found within the ransom note, cAcTuS.readme.txt, and is also self-declared within the note. Encrypted files carry the extension .cts1, although variations in the appended number have been observed across different incidents and victims. CACTUS uses a unique tactic by requiring a key for decrypting the binary, likely implemented to evade antivirus detection. This key is embedded within a file named ntuser.dat, loaded through a scheduled task. Kroll's research noted instances of data exfiltration and victim extortion over Tox, a peer-to-peer messaging service, but no known victim leak site was identified.In its operations, CACTUS demonstrates a consistent set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The initial exploit involves the exploitation of vulnerable VPN appliances, a prevalent method observed across multiple CACTUS incidents. Once inside the network, the threat actor conducts internal scouting using tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner and PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints, identify user accounts, and ping remote endpoints. To maintain persistence, CACTUS deploys various remote access methods, including legitimate tools like Splashtop, AnyDesk, and SuperOps RMM, along with malicious tools like Cobalt Strike and Chisel. The threat actor attempts to disable security software using custom scripts, such as TotalExec, and uninstall common antivirus software.
