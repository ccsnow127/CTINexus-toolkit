Example 1:

'CTI': Rhysida ransomware came to public attention in May 2023. The group has been associated with several significant breaches, including an attack on the Chilean Army where they leaked stolen documents on their data leak site. The threat actor was also linked to an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, impacting 17 hospitals and 166 clinics across the U.S. Following this attack, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HC3) classified Rhysida as a substantial threat to the healthcare sector. Rhysida typically gains access to a victim's system through phishing tactics, followed by the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the system. Additionally, the threat actors use PsExec to deploy both PowerShell scripts and the Rhysida ransomware payload. The PowerShell script, known as g.ps1 and identified as Trojan.PS1.SILENTKILL.A, serves various purposes for the threat actors, including terminating antivirus processes and services, erasing shadow copies, altering remote desktop protocol (RDP) configurations, and modifying the active directory (AD) password. Notably, during the execution of the script (g.ps1), it appears that the threat actors updated it, ultimately leading to a PowerShell version of Rhysida ransomware. Rhysida uses a 4096-bit RSA key and AES-CTR for file encryption. After successfully encrypting files, it appends the .rhysida extension to them and deposits a ransom note named CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 3:

'CTI': Mallox ransomware specifically targets computers running Microsoft Windows. This ransomware was first observed in June 2021 and is known for exploiting unsecured MS-SQL servers as a penetration vector to compromise victims' networks. The ransomware's targeted industries are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. The ransomware operators claim that their victims include worldwide organizations. According to Lior Rochberger, a senior security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, Mallox's sudden increase in activity is attributed to the deliberate actions taken by the group's leaders to expand Mallox's operations. Rochberger stated that group appeared to focus more on recruiting affiliates at the beginning of 2023. This shift in strategy explains the significant increase observed this year. Recently, researchers from Unit 42 have noticed a significant increase in Mallox ransomware activity, with a surge of almost 174% compared to 2022. This increase is primarily due to Mallox using vulnerable MS-SQL (CVE-2020-0618 and CVE-2019-1068) servers to spread the ransomware. Unit 42 also observed Mallox using tactics such as brute force, data exfiltration, and the use of network scanning tools. Researchers have also reported that the group has attempted to distribute Mallox via phishing emails - suggesting affiliates may be involved. Once the threat actors gain access, they use the command line and PowerShell to download the Mallox ransomware payload from a remote server. Like other ransomware groups, the initial payload tries to deactivate any services that might hinder data encryption on the targeted system. Also, it tries to erase shadow copies, making data recovery more challenging after encryption. The malware also attempts to eliminate all event logs, utilizing a commonly used Microsoft command utility to try and complicate forensic analysis. Like CryptNet, the threat actors behind Mallox use the double extortion method - stealing data before encrypting it. They also have a data leak site where they leak the data of victims that refuse to pay or negotiate its ransom demands. Victims negotiate with the threat actors by using a private key to authenticate themselves. As previously stated, the ransomware operators claim to have breached hundreds of organizations worldwide. Unit 42 stated that their telemetry indicates at least dozens of potential Mallox victims. In 2022, Mallox ransomware was discovered to be a variant of the TargetCompany ransomware strain.

Target report:

\"CTI\": ChromeLoader may seem on the surface like a run-of-the-mill browser hijacker that merely redirects victims to advertisement websites. However, its use of PowerShell could pose a greater risk by leading to further and advanced malicious activity, such as the propagation of ransomware or spyware or theft of browser-session data. Researchers are warning of the potential for ChromeLoader-which has seen a resurgence in activity recently-to pose a more sophisticated threat than typical malvertisers do, according to two separate blog posts by Malwarebytes Labs and Red Canary. ChromeLoader is a pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that eventually manifests as a browser extension, modifying victims\u2019 Chrome settings and redirecting user traffic to advertisement websites. On Windows machines, victims become infected with the malware through ISO files that poses as a cracked video game or pirated films or TV programs.
