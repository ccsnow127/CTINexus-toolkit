Example 1:

'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Example 2:

'CTI': Security researchers are observing exploitation attempts for the CVE-2023-22527 remote code execution flaw vulnerability that affects outdated versions of Atlassian Confluence servers. The flaw has a critical severity score and is described as a template injection weakness that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server endpoints. The service says that attackers are trying out callbacks by executing the 'whoami' command to gather information about the level of access and privileges on the system.

Example 3:

'CTI': CVE-2023-36884 is a remote code execution vulnerability that was previously patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to craft Microsoft Office documents in a way that circumvented the Mark of the Web (MoTW) security feature. This allowed the files to be opened without triggering a security warning, ultimately enabling remote code execution. To counteract a previously mitigated but actively exploited CVE-2023-36884 flaw, Microsoft has introduced an Office Defense in Depth update. The Russian threat actor Storm-0978/RomCom is responsible for actively exploiting this vulnerability. This group, previously recognized for deploying the Industrial Spy ransomware in their attacks, has now rebranded as 'Underground' and extorts victims through their ransomware operations.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Microsoft has released a workaround for a zero-day flaw that was initially flagged in April and that attackers already have used to target organizations in Russia and Tibet, researchers said. The remote control execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-3019, is associated with the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), which, ironically, itself collects information about bugs in the company\u2019s products and reports to Microsoft Support. If successfully exploited, attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user\u2019s rights, the company said. A remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word,\u201d Microsoft explained in its guidance on the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.
