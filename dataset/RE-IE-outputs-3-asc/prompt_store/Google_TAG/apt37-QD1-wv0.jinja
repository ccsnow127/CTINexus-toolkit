Example 1:

'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Example 2:

'CTI': A Chinese hacking group has been exploiting a critical vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) as a zero-day since at least late 2021. The flaw was patched in October, with VMware confirming this Wednesday that it's aware of CVE-2023-34048 in-the-wild exploitation, although it didn't share any other details on the attacks. However, as security firm Mandiant revealed today, the vulnerability was used by the UNC3886 Chinese cyber espionage group as part of a previously reported campaign, exposed in June 2023. The cyberspies used it to breach their targets' vCenter servers and compromised credentials to deploy VirtualPita and VirtualPie backdoors on ESXi hosts via maliciously crafted vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs). In the next stage, they exploited the CVE-2023-20867 VMware Tools authentication bypass flaw to escalate privileges, harvest files, and exfiltrate them from guest VMs.

Example 3:

'CTI': The Iranian advanced persistent threat actor and cyberespionage group, APT35, also known as Charming Kitten or Phosphorus, has been making headlines since 2014. During that time, the group launched one of the most sophisticated internet based spying campaigns organized by Iranian threat actors - a campaign conducted via social media. Since then, the group has not slowed down and has been responsible for several other cyber attacks around the world. In 2019, APT35 was responsible for targeting several academic institutions in the U.S, France, and the Middle East region. In late 2020, the group targeted medical research organizations in Israel and in the U.S. By 2021, APT35 was abusing Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities that were chained together (ProxyShell). As of 2022, APT35 has been observed using new tactics to attack a wide range of targets. Using a new strain of malware, the threat actors were able to use the malware for intelligence collection. The group has also been seen using a new tool called Hyperscrape to quietly extract emails from victim's mailboxes.

Target report:

\"CTI\": To protect our users, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) routinely hunts for 0-day vulnerabilities exploited in-the-wild. This blog will describe a 0-day vulnerability, discovered by TAG in late October 2022, embedded in malicious documents and used to target users in South Korea. We attribute this activity to a group of North Korean government-backed actors known as APT37. These malicious documents exploited an Internet Explorer 0-day vulnerability in the JScript engine, CVE-2022-41128. Our policy is to quickly report vulnerabilities to vendors, and within a few hours of discovering this 0-day, we reported it to Microsoft and patches were released to protect users from these attacks. This is not the first time APT37 has used Internet Explorer 0-day exploits to target users. The group has historically focused their targeting on South Korean users, North Korean defectors, policy makers, journalists and human rights activists.
