Example 1:

'CTI': Mallox ransomware specifically targets computers running Microsoft Windows. This ransomware was first observed in June 2021 and is known for exploiting unsecured MS-SQL servers as a penetration vector to compromise victims' networks. The ransomware's targeted industries are manufacturing, professional and legal services, and wholesale and retail. The ransomware operators claim that their victims include worldwide organizations. According to Lior Rochberger, a senior security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, Mallox's sudden increase in activity is attributed to the deliberate actions taken by the group's leaders to expand Mallox's operations. Rochberger stated that group appeared to focus more on recruiting affiliates at the beginning of 2023. This shift in strategy explains the significant increase observed this year. Recently, researchers from Unit 42 have noticed a significant increase in Mallox ransomware activity, with a surge of almost 174% compared to 2022. This increase is primarily due to Mallox using vulnerable MS-SQL (CVE-2020-0618 and CVE-2019-1068) servers to spread the ransomware. Unit 42 also observed Mallox using tactics such as brute force, data exfiltration, and the use of network scanning tools. Researchers have also reported that the group has attempted to distribute Mallox via phishing emails - suggesting affiliates may be involved. Once the threat actors gain access, they use the command line and PowerShell to download the Mallox ransomware payload from a remote server. Like other ransomware groups, the initial payload tries to deactivate any services that might hinder data encryption on the targeted system. Also, it tries to erase shadow copies, making data recovery more challenging after encryption. The malware also attempts to eliminate all event logs, utilizing a commonly used Microsoft command utility to try and complicate forensic analysis. Like CryptNet, the threat actors behind Mallox use the double extortion method - stealing data before encrypting it. They also have a data leak site where they leak the data of victims that refuse to pay or negotiate its ransom demands. Victims negotiate with the threat actors by using a private key to authenticate themselves. As previously stated, the ransomware operators claim to have breached hundreds of organizations worldwide. Unit 42 stated that their telemetry indicates at least dozens of potential Mallox victims. In 2022, Mallox ransomware was discovered to be a variant of the TargetCompany ransomware strain.

Example 2:

'CTI': Mastodon, the free and open-source decentralized social networking platform, has fixed a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to impersonate and take over any remote account. The newly fixed flaw is tracked as CVE-2024-23832 and stems from insufficient origin validation in Mastodon, allowing attackers to impersonate users and take over their accounts. In July 2023, the Mastodon team fixed another critical bug tracked as CVE-2023-36460 and dubbed 'TootRoot,' which allowed attackers to send 'toots' (the equivalent of tweets) that would create web shells on target instances. Attackers could leverage this flaw to completely compromise Mastodon servers, allowing them to access sensitive user information, communications, and plant backdoors.

Example 3:

'CTI': Security researchers are observing exploitation attempts for the CVE-2023-22527 remote code execution flaw vulnerability that affects outdated versions of Atlassian Confluence servers. The flaw has a critical severity score and is described as a template injection weakness that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server endpoints. The service says that attackers are trying out callbacks by executing the 'whoami' command to gather information about the level of access and privileges on the system.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Unit 42 researchers have investigated a series of destructive cyberattacks beginning in January 2023 and continuing as recently as October 2023, targeting the education and technology sectors in Israel. The attacks are characterized by attempts to steal sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property. Once the attackers stole the information, they deployed various wipers intended to cover the attackers' tracks and to render the infected endpoints unusable.
