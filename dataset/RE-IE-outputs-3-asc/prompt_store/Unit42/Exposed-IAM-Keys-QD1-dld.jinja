Example 1:

'CTI': Although Ragnar Locker was discovered by the FBI in April 2020, the group has actually been active since December 2019. Ragnar Locker is both the name of the ransomware group and the name of the ransomware. The gang works as a part of a ransomware family, which means they are associated with several ransomware variants or threat actor groups. Ragnar Locker is known for using the double extortion tactic, which involves threat actors exfiltrating sensitive data, then triggering the encryption attack, and ultimately threatening to leak the data if the demanded ransom isn't paid. To avoid prevention and detection, the threat actor frequently changes their obfuscation techniques. Ragnar Locker initiates their attacks by compromising the networks of companies through RDP service - using brute force to guess passwords or using stolen credentials purchased on the dark web. After compromising their target's network, the threat actor elevates their privileges by exploiting CVE-2017-0213 found in Windows COM Aggregate Marshaler. According to Microsoft, CVE-2017-0213 is an elevation of privilege that allows attackers to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker runs a specially crafted application.

Example 2:

'CTI': CISA and the FBI warned today that threat actors using Androxgh0st malware are building a botnet focused on cloud credential theft and using the stolen information to deliver additional malicious payloads. It scans for websites and servers vulnerable to the following remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-9841 (PHPUnit unit testing framework), CVE-2021-41773 (Apache HTTP Server), and CVE-2018-15133 (Laravel PHP web framework). Androxgh0st is a Python-scripted malware primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information, such as credentials for various high profile applications, i.e., Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework. Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning and exploiting exposed credentials and application programming interfaces (APIs), and web shell deployment. Stolen Twilio and SendGrid credentials can be used by the threat actors to conduct spam campaigns impersonating the breached companies.

Example 3:

'CTI': GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Unit 42 researchers have identified an active campaign we are calling EleKtra-Leak, which performs automated targeting of exposed identity and access management (IAM) credentials within public GitHub repositories. AWS detects and auto-remediates much of the threat of exposed credentials in popular source code repositories by applying a special quarantine policy \u2014 but by manually removing that automatic protection, we were able to develop deeper insights into the activities that the actor would carry out in the case where compromised credentials are obtained in some other way. In those cases, the threat actor associated with the campaign was able to create multiple AWS Elastic Compute (EC2) instances that they used for wide-ranging and long-lasting cryptojacking operations. We believe these operations have been active for at least two years and are still active today.
