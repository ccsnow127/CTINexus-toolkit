Example 1:

'CTI': In early 2023, it was revealed that the Clop ransomware gang had breached 130 companies and organizations by leveraging a critical remote code execution flaw in GoAnywhere MFT. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-0669 and had been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability since January 18, 2023. Fortra discovered its exploitation on February 3, 2023, and released patches three days later. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, with Clop conducting widespread data theft attacks that impacted organizations worldwide, causing data leaks, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. Some notable victims of those attacks include Crown Resorts, CHS, Hatch Bank, Rubrik, the City of Toronto, Hitachi Energy, Procter & Gamble, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Example 2:

'CTI': Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

'triplets': [{'subject': 'GitLab instances', 'relation': 'are vulnerable to', 'object': 'CVE-2023-7028'}, {'subject': 'CVE-2023-7028', 'relation': 'is a', 'object': 'zero-click account takeover flaw'}, {'subject': 'GitLab', 'relation': 'warned about', 'object': 'CVE-2023-7028'}, {'subject': 'CVE-2023-7028', 'relation': 'has', 'object': 'CVSS score: 10.0'}, {'subject': 'attackers', 'relation': 'send', 'object': 'password reset emails'}, {'subject': 'password reset emails', 'relation': 'are for', 'object': 'a targeted account'}, {'subject': 'password reset emails', 'relation': 'are sent to', 'object': 'an attacker-controlled email address'}, {'subject': 'the threat actor', 'relation': 'change', 'object': 'the password'}, {'subject': 'the threat actor', 'relation': 'take over', 'object': 'the account'}, {'subject': 'GitLab', 'relation': 'is', 'object': 'a software development'}, {'subject': 'GitLab', 'relation': 'is', 'object': 'a project planning platform'}, {'subject': 'the servers', 'relation': 'are at risk of', 'object': 'supply chain attacks'}, {'subject': 'the servers', 'relation': 'are at risk of', 'object': 'proprietary code disclosure'}, {'subject': 'these servers', 'relation': 'are at risk of', 'object': 'API key leaks'}]

Example 3:

'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Target report:

\"CTI\": APT29, the notorious Russian advanced persistent threat behind the 2020 SolarWinds hack, is actively exploiting a critical security vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity that could open the door to rampant software supply chain attacks.That's the word from CISA, the FBI, the NSA, and a host of international partners, who said in a joint alert today that APT29 (aka CozyBear, the Dukes, Midnight Blizzard, or Nobelium) is hammering servers hosting TeamCity software at a large scale using the unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) bug. According to the feds, the exploitation of the issue, tracked as CVE-2023-42793 (CVSS score of 9.8), started in September after JetBrains patched the flaw and Rapid7 released a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for it; but now, it has grown to be a worrying global phenomenon that could result in widespread damage.
