Example 1:

'CTI': A Chinese hacking group has been exploiting a critical vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) as a zero-day since at least late 2021. The flaw was patched in October, with VMware confirming this Wednesday that it's aware of CVE-2023-34048 in-the-wild exploitation, although it didn't share any other details on the attacks. However, as security firm Mandiant revealed today, the vulnerability was used by the UNC3886 Chinese cyber espionage group as part of a previously reported campaign, exposed in June 2023. The cyberspies used it to breach their targets' vCenter servers and compromised credentials to deploy VirtualPita and VirtualPie backdoors on ESXi hosts via maliciously crafted vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs). In the next stage, they exploited the CVE-2023-20867 VMware Tools authentication bypass flaw to escalate privileges, harvest files, and exfiltrate them from guest VMs.

Example 2:

'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Example 3:

'CTI': Google has released security updates to fix the first Chrome zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild since the start of the year. \u200bThe high-severity zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-0519) is due to a high-severity out-of-bounds memory access weakness in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which remote attackers can exploit via a crafted HTML page to gain access to data beyond the memory buffer through heap corruption, providing them access to sensitive information or triggering a crash. Besides unauthorized access to out-of-bounds memory, CVE-2024-0519 could also be exploited to bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR to make it easier to achieve code execution via another weakness.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Google has rolled out security updates for the Chrome web browser to address a high-severity zero-day flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-7024, has been described as a heap-based buffer overflow bug in the WebRTC framework that could be exploited to result in program crashes or arbitrary code execution. Cl\u00e9ment Lecigne and Vlad Stolyarov of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on December 19, 2023. No other details about the security defect have been released to prevent further abuse, with Google acknowledging that an exploit for CVE-2023-7024 exists in the wild. Given that WebRTC is an open-source project and that it's also supported by Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, it's currently not clear if the flaw has any impact beyond Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.
