Example 1:

'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Iranian advanced persistent threat actor and cyberespionage group, APT35, also known as Charming Kitten or Phosphorus, has been making headlines since 2014. During that time, the group launched one of the most sophisticated internet based spying campaigns organized by Iranian threat actors - a campaign conducted via social media. Since then, the group has not slowed down and has been responsible for several other cyber attacks around the world. In 2019, APT35 was responsible for targeting several academic institutions in the U.S, France, and the Middle East region. In late 2020, the group targeted medical research organizations in Israel and in the U.S. By 2021, APT35 was abusing Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities that were chained together (ProxyShell). As of 2022, APT35 has been observed using new tactics to attack a wide range of targets. Using a new strain of malware, the threat actors were able to use the malware for intelligence collection. The group has also been seen using a new tool called Hyperscrape to quietly extract emails from victim's mailboxes.

Example 3:

'CTI': CISA and the FBI warned today that threat actors using Androxgh0st malware are building a botnet focused on cloud credential theft and using the stolen information to deliver additional malicious payloads. It scans for websites and servers vulnerable to the following remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-9841 (PHPUnit unit testing framework), CVE-2021-41773 (Apache HTTP Server), and CVE-2018-15133 (Laravel PHP web framework). Androxgh0st is a Python-scripted malware primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information, such as credentials for various high profile applications, i.e., Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework. Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning and exploiting exposed credentials and application programming interfaces (APIs), and web shell deployment. Stolen Twilio and SendGrid credentials can be used by the threat actors to conduct spam campaigns impersonating the breached companies.

Target report:

\"CTI\": We found samples that show how malicious actors are using Discord as part of a campaign involving malicious spam emails that eventually end in an AveMaria or AgentTesla malware infection. We first observed the use of malicious spam to deliver these malware families in 2019 \u2014 however, the addition of Discord as part of its attack routine is relatively recent. The malicious emails are typically either postal delivery notifications or invoices with an included DHL or TNT-themed attachment. These emails come with embedded links \u2014 either in the images or the text \u2014 that point to a Discord URL with the following format: hxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/{ChannelID}/{AttachmentID}/example[.]exe. These URLs are used to host AveMaria and AgentTesla, which will then infect the users' machines once they click on the executable.
