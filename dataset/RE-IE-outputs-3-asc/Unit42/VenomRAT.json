        "text": "Researchers should be aware of threat actors repurposing older proof of concept (PoC) code to quickly craft a fake PoC for a newly released vulnerability. On Aug. 17, 2023, the Zero Day Initiative publicly reported a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in WinRAR tracked as CVE-2023-40477. They had disclosed it to the vendor on June 8, 2023. Four days after the public reporting of CVE-2023-40477, an actor using an alias of whalersplonk committed a fake PoC script to their GitHub repository. The fake PoC meant to exploit this WinRAR vulnerability was based on a publicly available PoC script that exploited a SQL injection vulnerability in an application called GeoServer, which is tracked as CVE-2023-25157. We analyzed the fake PoC script and all the links in the infection chain, which ultimately installed a VenomRAT payload.",
