        "text": "We found Operation Earth Kitsune using a total of five C&C servers, seven samples, and four new bugs, aiming to compromise websites to host malware. We initiated our investigation after noticing that the Korean American National Coordinating Council (KANCC) website was redirecting visitors to the Hanseattle website. Users who accessed the said site were redirected to a weaponized version of a proof of concept (POC) for the CVE-2019-5782 Google Chrome vulnerability published in the chromium tracking system. Digging deeper, we discovered that the attack does not only involve a weaponized version of the mentioned Chrome exploit; the exploit was infecting the victim machine with three separate malware samples.",
