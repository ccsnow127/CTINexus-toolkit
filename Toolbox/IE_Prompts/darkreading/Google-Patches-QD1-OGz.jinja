'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Example 1:

'CTI': Discovered in August 2021, Quantum ransomware is linked to the Quantum Locker operation. Quantum Locker has had a few rebrands (AstroLocker, MountLocker, and XingLocker). Our technology partner, AdvIntel, confirmed that Quantum is a splinter group from Conti and that the ransomware operation was taken over by Conti Team Two in April 2022 - keeping Quantum's original name. In June 2022, Quantum was observed employing their version of BazarCall, called Jormungandr, and hiring people who specialized in OSINT, spamming, design, and call center operations. BazarCall is a method that is also known as call-back phishing. This tactic emerged in early 2021 as an attack vector used by Ryuk ransomware (later evolving into Conti). BazarCall is used to gain initial access into a victim's network and involves emailing victims. The emails allege that a paid subscription is up for automatic renewal, but the renewal can be cancelled if the victim calls a specific number. Once the victim calls the number, the threat actor on the other end of the line convinces the victim via social engineering to start a remote access session by the use of legitimate software controlled by a network intruder. While the victim is distracted on the call, the intruder tries to figure out how to compromise the victim's network without triggering alarms. These kinds of attacks are highly targeted and make it difficult for cyber security professionals to detect due to the social engineering aspect of the attack. AdvIntel believes that the switch to social engineering is more than likely due to the predictability of ransomware attacks, causing profits to decline for adversaries. If threat actors like Quantum are able to trick people, they can have a more flexible approach to their attacks - making them difficult to defend. Quantum's BazarCall campaigns have grown more sophisticated in just two months' time. They've impersonated a large number of brands, including: Gobble, Luchechko Mortgage Team, CrowdStrike, HelloFresh, Oracle, Ginyard International US Equal Opportunity Employment Commission

Example 2:

'CTI': United States organizations within the financial sector are currently being attacked by a recently discovered ransomware operation named, Yanluowang. The ransomware operation is highly experienced with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and could be linked to veteran RaaS groups, Fivehands and Thieflock. Although the group is primarily focused on attacking organizations within the financial sector, they have also targeted companies in manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering. Let's take a look at Yanluowang's techniques, tactics, and how they may be connected to Fivehands and Thieflock. In October 2021, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, a division of Broadcom Software, discovered that Yanluowang ransomware was actively being used by a threat actor who was seen attacking U.S. corporations since at least August 2021. What was interesting about the attack was that many of the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used were previously used by ransomware threat actor, Thieflock. Most analysts assumed that the threat actor using Yanluowang must be an affiliate of Thieflock who shifted allegiances. Although Yanluowang attempted to attack a large organization in October 2021 by deploying ransomware, they were not successful due to the ransomware being somewhat underdeveloped. According to Symantec, their Threat Hunter Team initially discovered the use of AdFind, a legitimate command-line Active Directory query tool, on the undisclosed target's network. Ransomware attackers often use AdFind as a reconnaissance tool. The tool also equipped attackers with resources that they needed for lateral movement by way of Active Directory. Days after discovering the suspicious use of AdFind, attackers attempted to deploy Yanluowang ransomware.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The latest zero-day, which Google is tracking as CVE-2023-6345, stems from an integer overflow issue in Skia, an open source 2D graphic library in Chrome. The bug is one of seven Chrome vulnerabilities for which Google issued a security update this week. The company's advisory contained sparse details on CVE-2023-6345 beyond mentioning the fact that an exploit for it is publicly available. A brief description on NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) site described the flaw as affecting versions of Chrome prior to 119.0.6045.199 and allowing a remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a malicious file.
