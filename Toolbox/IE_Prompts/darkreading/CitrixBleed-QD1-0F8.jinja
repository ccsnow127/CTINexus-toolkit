Example 0:

'CTI': Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

Example 1:

'CTI': In May 2023, Kroll Cyber Threat Intelligence analysts published their discoveries of a new ransomware variant referred to as CACTUS, which has been actively targeting large commercial entities since March 2023. The name CACTUS is derived from the filename found within the ransom note, cAcTuS.readme.txt, and is also self-declared within the note. Encrypted files carry the extension .cts1, although variations in the appended number have been observed across different incidents and victims. CACTUS uses a unique tactic by requiring a key for decrypting the binary, likely implemented to evade antivirus detection. This key is embedded within a file named ntuser.dat, loaded through a scheduled task. Kroll's research noted instances of data exfiltration and victim extortion over Tox, a peer-to-peer messaging service, but no known victim leak site was identified.In its operations, CACTUS demonstrates a consistent set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The initial exploit involves the exploitation of vulnerable VPN appliances, a prevalent method observed across multiple CACTUS incidents. Once inside the network, the threat actor conducts internal scouting using tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner and PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints, identify user accounts, and ping remote endpoints. To maintain persistence, CACTUS deploys various remote access methods, including legitimate tools like Splashtop, AnyDesk, and SuperOps RMM, along with malicious tools like Cobalt Strike and Chisel. The threat actor attempts to disable security software using custom scripts, such as TotalExec, and uninstall common antivirus software.

Example 2:

'CTI': This report is an overview of the FiveHands Ransomware variant that successfully attacked an organization (CISA release date May 6, 2021). CISA reports that the variant used publicly-available pen test and exploitation tools, plus FiveHands ransomware and SombRAT remote access trojan (RAT), to steal information, obfuscate files, accomplish network discovery, accomplish credential access, and demand ransom from the victim. Tools used include SoftPerfect Network Scanner, FiveHands ransomware, PsExec.exe, ServeManager.exe, SombRAT, RouterScan.exe, grabff.exe, rclone.exe, and s3browser-9-5-3.exe. The initial access vector was a zero-day vulnerability in a VPN product. What followed is that the bad actor used SoftPerfect Network Scanner for the discovery of hostnames and network services. PsExec was then used to execute ServeManager.exe (what CISA calls FiveHands ransomware). FiveHands is a novel ransomware variant that uses a public key encryption scheme called NTRUEncrypt. Note: the NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem encryption algorithm (NTRU), is a lattice-based alternative to Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, known as RSA, and Elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, and is based on the shortest vector problem in a lattice. To prevent data recovery, FiveHands uses WMI to first enumerate then delete Volume Shadow copies. The malware also encrypts files in the recovery folder. After the files are encrypted, the program will write a ransom note to each folder and directory on the system.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Since at least August, attackers have been exploiting CVE-2023-4966 (aka CitrixBleed), a 7.5 high-severity vulnerability affecting Citrix Systems' NetScaler ADC and Gateway networking products. Even after it was brought to light in October, many organizations have struggled to comprehensively shore up their systems. One such organization appears to be Comcast Xfinity. On Monday, the cable giant disclosed a CitrixBleed-enabled breach of its customer data, including usernames and hashed passwords, and, for some, names, contact information, last four digits of Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and security questions and answers.
