Example 0:

'CTI': A recently uncovered ransomware operation named 'Kasseika' has joined the club of threat actors that employs Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) tactics to disable antivirus software before encrypting files. Kasseika abuses the Martini driver (Martini.sys/viragt64.sys), part of TG Soft's VirtIT Agent System, to disable antivirus products protecting the targeted system. Kasseika attacks start with a phishing email sent to employees of the targeted organization, attempting to steal their account credentials, which will then be used for initial access to the corporate network. Next, Kasseika operators abuse the Windows PsExec tool to execute malicious .bat files on the infected system and others they have accessed through lateral movement. The batch file checks for the presence of a process named 'Martini.exe' and terminates it to avoid interference. Next, it downloads the vulnerable 'Martini.sys' driver on the machine. By using BYOVD attacks, aka exploiting flaws in the loaded driver, the malware gains the privileges to terminate 991 processes from a hardcoded list, many of which correspond to antivirus products, security tools, analysis tools, and system utilities.

Example 1:

'CTI': Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

Example 2:

'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Target report:

\"CTI\": RansomExx is a ransomware variant that debuted as Defray777 in 2018. It made a name for itself in 2020, after it was used in widely reported attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other such high-profile only months apart. By then, it was dubbed RansomEXX after the string \u201cransom.exx\u201d was found in its binary. In 2020, the group also started a leak site for publishing stolen data.Today, RansomEXX remains an active name among other ransomware variants like LockBit and Conti. Like other groups, the one running RansomEXX appears to have no qualms about publishing data stolen from its targets. It has also published information stolen from government agencies \u2014 a recent case was an attack on a Scottish mental health charity in March 2022, where they published 12GB worth of data that included the personal information and even credit card details of the charity's volunteers.
