'CTI': Exploit code is now available for a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT (Managed File Transfer) software that allows attackers to create new admin users on unpatched instances via the administration portal. GoAnywhere MFT is a web-based managed file transfer tool that helps organizations transfer files securely with partners and keep audit logs of who accessed all shared files. Today, almost seven weeks later, security researchers with Horizon3's Attack Team published a technical analysis of the vulnerability and shared a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that helps create new admin users on vulnerable GoAnywhere MFT instances exposed online. Their exploit takes advantage of the path traversal issue at the root of CVE-2024-0204 to access the vulnerable /InitialAccountSetup.xhtml endpoint and start the initial account setup screen to create a new administrator account.

Example 1:

'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Example 2:

'CTI': Over 5,300 internet-exposed GitLab instances are vulnerable to CVE-2023-7028, a zero-click account takeover flaw GitLab warned about earlier this month. The critical (CVSS score: 10.0) flaw allows attackers to send password reset emails for a targeted account to an attacker-controlled email address, allowing the threat actor to change the password and take over the account. Based on GitLab's role as a software development and project planning platform and the type and severity of the flaw, these servers are at risk of supply chain attacks, proprietary code disclosure, API key leaks, and other malicious activity.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Crysis/Dharma ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.CRYSIS.TIBGGS) has released a hacking toolkit named Toolbox, Sophos reports. Toolbox contains Mimikatz to harvest passwords, NirSoft Remote Desktop PassView to steal remote desktop protocol (RDP) passwords, Hash Suite Tools Free to dump hashes, and other tools to help find target computers and deploy the ransomware payload. With this kit, even rookie hackers can infiltrate networks easily. Crysis operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, and this hacking tool only makes it easier for affiliates to spread the ransomware to more targets.
