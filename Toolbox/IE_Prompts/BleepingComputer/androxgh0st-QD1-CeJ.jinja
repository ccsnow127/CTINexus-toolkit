Example 0:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 1:

'CTI': Discovered in August 2021, Quantum ransomware is linked to the Quantum Locker operation. Quantum Locker has had a few rebrands (AstroLocker, MountLocker, and XingLocker). Our technology partner, AdvIntel, confirmed that Quantum is a splinter group from Conti and that the ransomware operation was taken over by Conti Team Two in April 2022 - keeping Quantum's original name. In June 2022, Quantum was observed employing their version of BazarCall, called Jormungandr, and hiring people who specialized in OSINT, spamming, design, and call center operations. BazarCall is a method that is also known as call-back phishing. This tactic emerged in early 2021 as an attack vector used by Ryuk ransomware (later evolving into Conti). BazarCall is used to gain initial access into a victim's network and involves emailing victims. The emails allege that a paid subscription is up for automatic renewal, but the renewal can be cancelled if the victim calls a specific number. Once the victim calls the number, the threat actor on the other end of the line convinces the victim via social engineering to start a remote access session by the use of legitimate software controlled by a network intruder. While the victim is distracted on the call, the intruder tries to figure out how to compromise the victim's network without triggering alarms. These kinds of attacks are highly targeted and make it difficult for cyber security professionals to detect due to the social engineering aspect of the attack. AdvIntel believes that the switch to social engineering is more than likely due to the predictability of ransomware attacks, causing profits to decline for adversaries. If threat actors like Quantum are able to trick people, they can have a more flexible approach to their attacks - making them difficult to defend. Quantum's BazarCall campaigns have grown more sophisticated in just two months' time. They've impersonated a large number of brands, including: Gobble, Luchechko Mortgage Team, CrowdStrike, HelloFresh, Oracle, Ginyard International US Equal Opportunity Employment Commission

Example 2:

'CTI': A new vulnerability dubbed 'LeftoverLocals' affecting graphics processing units from AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and Imagination Technologies allows retrieving data from the local memory space. Tracked as CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations.

Target report:

\"CTI\": CISA and the FBI warned today that threat actors using Androxgh0st malware are building a botnet focused on cloud credential theft and using the stolen information to deliver additional malicious payloads. It scans for websites and servers vulnerable to the following remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-9841 (PHPUnit unit testing framework), CVE-2021-41773 (Apache HTTP Server), and CVE-2018-15133 (Laravel PHP web framework). Androxgh0st is a Python-scripted malware primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information, such as credentials for various high profile applications, i.e., Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework. Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning and exploiting exposed credentials and application programming interfaces (APIs), and web shell deployment. Stolen Twilio and SendGrid credentials can be used by the threat actors to conduct spam campaigns impersonating the breached companies.
