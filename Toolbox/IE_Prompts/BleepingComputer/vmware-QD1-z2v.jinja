Example 0:

'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Example 1:

'CTI': Rhysida ransomware came to public attention in May 2023. The group has been associated with several significant breaches, including an attack on the Chilean Army where they leaked stolen documents on their data leak site. The threat actor was also linked to an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, impacting 17 hospitals and 166 clinics across the U.S. Following this attack, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HC3) classified Rhysida as a substantial threat to the healthcare sector. Rhysida typically gains access to a victim's system through phishing tactics, followed by the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the system. Additionally, the threat actors use PsExec to deploy both PowerShell scripts and the Rhysida ransomware payload. The PowerShell script, known as g.ps1 and identified as Trojan.PS1.SILENTKILL.A, serves various purposes for the threat actors, including terminating antivirus processes and services, erasing shadow copies, altering remote desktop protocol (RDP) configurations, and modifying the active directory (AD) password. Notably, during the execution of the script (g.ps1), it appears that the threat actors updated it, ultimately leading to a PowerShell version of Rhysida ransomware. Rhysida uses a 4096-bit RSA key and AES-CTR for file encryption. After successfully encrypting files, it appends the .rhysida extension to them and deposits a ransom note named CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.

Example 2:

'CTI': A new vulnerability dubbed 'LeftoverLocals' affecting graphics processing units from AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and Imagination Technologies allows retrieving data from the local memory space. Tracked as CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations.

Target report:

\"CTI\": A Chinese hacking group has been exploiting a critical vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2023-34048) as a zero-day since at least late 2021. The flaw was patched in October, with VMware confirming this Wednesday that it's aware of CVE-2023-34048 in-the-wild exploitation, although it didn't share any other details on the attacks. However, as security firm Mandiant revealed today, the vulnerability was used by the UNC3886 Chinese cyber espionage group as part of a previously reported campaign, exposed in June 2023. The cyberspies used it to breach their targets' vCenter servers and compromised credentials to deploy VirtualPita and VirtualPie backdoors on ESXi hosts via maliciously crafted vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs). In the next stage, they exploited the CVE-2023-20867 VMware Tools authentication bypass flaw to escalate privileges, harvest files, and exfiltrate them from guest VMs.
