Example 0:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 1:

'CTI': A new vulnerability dubbed 'LeftoverLocals' affecting graphics processing units from AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and Imagination Technologies allows retrieving data from the local memory space. Tracked as CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations.

Example 2:

'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.
