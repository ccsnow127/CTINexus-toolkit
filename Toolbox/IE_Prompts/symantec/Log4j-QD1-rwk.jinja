'CTI': Fancy Bear, also known as APT 28, Sofacy, or Swallowtail, is a cyberespionage group that is linked to the Russian government. The group has been in operation since 2008, targeting the energy, government, media, aerospace, and defense sectors via phishing campaigns and credential harvesting. Fancy Bear is known to target both computers and mobile devices, running multiple intrusion operations concurrently. In 2016, Fancy Bear was front and center after they attacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The group was also responsible for leaking confidential drug testing information after they attacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) during the same year. Fancy Bear took credit for the attack and leaked the stolen information on a site named Fancy Bears. Despite two very public attacks, Fancy Bear returned to the shadows in 2017. Since that time, the group's activities have become clandestine, motivated by intelligence gathering. Between 2017 and 2018, Fancy Bear targeted the following organizations: European military, European government, A South American country's government, An Eastern European embassy, A prominent international organization. After much attention, Fancy Bear became more discreet, and not much was heard from the APT until their recent attacks on Ukrainians. In July 2022, researchers from Malwarebytes observed malicious activity from the group. They were sending malicious documents that contained an exploit for the Microsoft zero-day, Follina (CVE-2022-30190).

Example 1:

'CTI': Vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers are currently being targeted by threat actors and infected with FARGO ransomware (also known as Mallox and TargetCompany). Microsoft's SQL servers hold data for internet services and apps. A disruption  to these databases by FARGO could cause severe issues for businesses. In February 2022, the threat actors behind FARGO attacks dropped Cobalt Strike beacons, and by July 2022, they were hijacking vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers to steal bandwidth for their own proxy services. The latest FARGO attacks blackmail database owners into paying the demanded ransom. If the owners refuse to pay the ransom, the threat actors threaten to expose their stolen files on Telegram. FARGO is one of the most popular ransomware strains that focuses on Microsoft SQL servers. The ransomware infection starts by using powershell.exe and cmd.exe to download a .NET file to a compromised machine. After the payload fetches additional malware, a .BAT file terminates certain processes and services. To ensure that businesses can't recover their data, FARGO executes the recovery deactivation command and kills processes prior to initiating encryption. Once encryption is complete, FARGO renames locked files using the '.Fargo3' extension and generates a ransom note titled 'RECOVERY FILES.txt'. The threat actors expect the demanded ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. Database servers are often compromised via brute-force, and if a threat actor is able to use brute-force in their attack, it's likely due to their target having weak credentials. The threat actor may also try to attack a database server by exploiting well-known and unpatched vulnerabilities. It's important that organizations keep their devices updated with the latest security patches and maintain strong passwords.

Example 2:

'CTI': Microsoft warned Friday night that some of its corporate email accounts were breached and data stolen by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Midnight Blizzard. The company detected the attack on January 12th, with Microsoft's investigation ultimately determining that the attack was conducted by Russian threat actors known more commonly as Nobelium or APT29. Microsoft says the threat actors breached their systems in November 2023 when they conducted a password spray attack to access a legacy non-production test tenant account. Microsoft says the breached email accounts included members of Microsoft's leadership team and employees in the cybersecurity and legal departments, from which the hackers stole emails and attachments.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Log4j has been making headlines recently after the public disclosure of three critical vulnerabilities in the utility which can lead to remote code execution (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) and denial of service (CVE-2021-45105). The initial remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been dubbed Log4Shell and has dominated cyber-security news ever since it was publicly disclosed on December 9. The vulnerability has been exploited to deploy a plethora of payloads like coin miners, Dridex malware, and even ransomware such as Conti.
