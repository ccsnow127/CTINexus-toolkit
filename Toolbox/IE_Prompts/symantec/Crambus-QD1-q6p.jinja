Example 0:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 1:

'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Example 2:

'CTI': In early 2023, it was revealed that the Clop ransomware gang had breached 130 companies and organizations by leveraging a critical remote code execution flaw in GoAnywhere MFT. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-0669 and had been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability since January 18, 2023. Fortra discovered its exploitation on February 3, 2023, and released patches three days later. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, with Clop conducting widespread data theft attacks that impacted organizations worldwide, causing data leaks, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. Some notable victims of those attacks include Crown Resorts, CHS, Hatch Bank, Rubrik, the City of Toronto, Hitachi Energy, Procter & Gamble, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Target report:

\"CTI\": The Iranian Crambus espionage group (aka OilRig, APT34) staged an eight-month-long intrusion against a government in the Middle East between February and September 2023. During the compromise, the attackers stole files and passwords and, in one case, installed a PowerShell backdoor (dubbed PowerExchange) that was used to monitor incoming mails sent from an Exchange Server in order to execute commands sent by the attackers in the form of emails, and surreptitiously forwarded results  to the attackers. Malicious activity occurred on at least 12 computers and there is evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on dozens more. In addition to deploying malware, the attackers made frequent use of the publicly available network administration tool Plink to configure port-forwarding rules on compromised machines, enabling remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). There is also evidence the attackers modified Windows firewall rules in order to enable remote access.
