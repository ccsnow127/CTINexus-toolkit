"CTI": This malware family uses the .NET framework and leverages the domain name service (DNS) protocol to create a covert channel and provide different backdoor functionalities. Threat actors have used this and the other two tools in multiple attacks targeting organizations across the U.S., Middle East, and Africa. Its C2 infrastructure dates back to 2020.

"CTI": Early this year, Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers found Fighting Ursa leveraging a zero-day exploit in Microsoft Outlook (now known as CVE-2023-23397). This vulnerability is especially concerning since it does not require user interaction to exploit. Unit 42 researchers have observed this group using CVE-2023-23397 over the past 20 months to target at least 30 organizations within 14 nations that are of likely strategic intelligence value to the Russian government and its military. During this time, Fighting Ursa conducted at least two campaigns with this vulnerability that have been made public. The first occurred between March-December 2022, and the second occurred in March 2023. Unit 42 researchers discovered a third, recently active campaign in which Fighting Ursa also used this vulnerability. The group conducted this most recent campaign between September and October 2023, targeting at least nine organizations in seven nations. Of the 14 nations targeted throughout all three campaigns, all are organizations within NATO member countries, except for entities in Ukraine, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. These organizations included critical infrastructure and entities that provide an information advantage in diplomatic, economic, and military affairs. Fighting Ursa (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Strontium/Forest Blizzard, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, or Sednit) is a group associated with Russia"s military intelligence, and they are well known for their focus on targets of Russian interest â€“ especially those of military interest. Fighting Ursa has been attributed to Russia"s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Special Service Centre (GTsSS) military intelligence Unit 26165.

"CTI": SilverRAT shows that the region"s cybercriminal groups are becoming more sophisticated, according to Cyfirma"s analysis. The first version of SilverRAT, whose source code was leaked by unknown actors in October, consists of a builder that allows the user to construct a remote access Trojan with specific features. The more interesting features, according to Cyfirma"s analysis, include using either an IP address or webpage for command and control, bypasses for antivirus software, the ability to erase system restore points, and the delayed execution of payloads. At least two threat actors - one using the handle "Dangerous silver" and a second using "Monstermc" - are the developers behind both SilverRAT and a previous program, S500 RAT, according to Cyfirma"s analysis. The hackers operate on Telegram and through online forums where they sell malware-as-a-service, distribute cracked RATs from other developers, and offer a variety of other services. In addition, they have a blog and website called Anonymous Arabic.
