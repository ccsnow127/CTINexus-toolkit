'CTI': After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 - a temporary name given by the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S. The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via malicious advertisements. Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques. In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other ransomware operation's encryptors, such as BlackCat. By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United Kingdom's most popular racing circuits - Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed, but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal's ransomware is secure, its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups, Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files rather than using randomly generated extensions.

Example 1:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 2:

'CTI': Fancy Bear, also known as APT 28, Sofacy, or Swallowtail, is a cyberespionage group that is linked to the Russian government. The group has been in operation since 2008, targeting the energy, government, media, aerospace, and defense sectors via phishing campaigns and credential harvesting. Fancy Bear is known to target both computers and mobile devices, running multiple intrusion operations concurrently. In 2016, Fancy Bear was front and center after they attacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The group was also responsible for leaking confidential drug testing information after they attacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) during the same year. Fancy Bear took credit for the attack and leaked the stolen information on a site named Fancy Bears. Despite two very public attacks, Fancy Bear returned to the shadows in 2017. Since that time, the group's activities have become clandestine, motivated by intelligence gathering. Between 2017 and 2018, Fancy Bear targeted the following organizations: European military, European government, A South American country's government, An Eastern European embassy, A prominent international organization. After much attention, Fancy Bear became more discreet, and not much was heard from the APT until their recent attacks on Ukrainians. In July 2022, researchers from Malwarebytes observed malicious activity from the group. They were sending malicious documents that contained an exploit for the Microsoft zero-day, Follina (CVE-2022-30190).

Target report:

\"CTI\": A new zero-day security flaw has been discovered in Apache OfBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that could be exploited to bypass authentication protections.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-51467, resides in the login functionality and is the result of an incomplete patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-49070, CVSS score: 9.8) that was released earlier this month. CVE-2023-49070 refers to a pre-authenticated remote code execution flaw impacting versions prior to 18.12.10 that, when successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to gain full control over the server and siphon sensitive data. It is caused due to a deprecated XML-RPC component within Apache OFBiz. CVE-2023-51467 could be triggered using empty and invalid USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters in an HTTP request to return an authentication success message, effectively circumventing the protection and enabling a threat actor to access otherwise unauthorized internal resources.
