'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Example 1:

'CTI': In early 2023, it was revealed that the Clop ransomware gang had breached 130 companies and organizations by leveraging a critical remote code execution flaw in GoAnywhere MFT. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-0669 and had been exploited as a zero-day vulnerability since January 18, 2023. Fortra discovered its exploitation on February 3, 2023, and released patches three days later. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, with Clop conducting widespread data theft attacks that impacted organizations worldwide, causing data leaks, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. Some notable victims of those attacks include Crown Resorts, CHS, Hatch Bank, Rubrik, the City of Toronto, Hitachi Energy, Procter & Gamble, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Example 2:

'CTI': Security researchers are observing exploitation attempts for the CVE-2023-22527 remote code execution flaw vulnerability that affects outdated versions of Atlassian Confluence servers. The flaw has a critical severity score and is described as a template injection weakness that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server endpoints. The service says that attackers are trying out callbacks by executing the 'whoami' command to gather information about the level of access and privileges on the system.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Over the years, TAG has analyzed a range of persistent threats including COLDRIVER (also known as UNC4057, Star Blizzard and Callisto), a Russian threat group focused on credential phishing activities against high profile individuals in NGOs, former intelligence and military officers, and NATO governments. For years, TAG has been countering and reporting on this group\u2019s efforts to conduct espionage aligned with the interests of the Russian government. To add to the community\u2019s understanding of COLDRIVER activity, we\u2019re shining light on their extended capabilities which now includes the use of malware. COLDRIVER continues its focus on credential phishing against Ukraine, NATO countries, academic institutions and NGOs. In order to gain the trust of targets, COLDRIVER often utilizes impersonation accounts, pretending to be an expert in a particular field or somehow affiliated with the target. The impersonation account is then used to establish a rapport with the target, increasing the likelihood of the phishing campaign's success, and eventually sends a phishing link or document containing a link.
