'CTI': After emerging in January 2022, Royal ransomware is a ransomware strain that is being distributed by ransomware threat actors from previous operations. Initially, Microsoft attributed the distribution of Royal ransomware to DEV-0569 - a temporary name given by the tech company. Now, researchers are stating that the threat actors behind Royal ransomware have officially branded themselves with the name Royal (the name left behind in recent ransomware notes) and they are primarily focused on targeting entities within the U.S. The ransomware operation uses unusual techniques to breach networks before encrypting them with malware and demanding ransom payments. Some Royal ransomware campaigns distribute the malware via malicious attachments, and some distribute the malware via malicious advertisements. Although Royal is a newer ransomware operation, researchers believe the threat actors behind it are very experienced due to evidence of previously seen tactics and techniques. In September 2022, the operators behind Royal ransomware began ramping up their malicious activities. They were observed by our technology partner, AdvIntel, utilizing other ransomware operation's encryptors, such as BlackCat. By November 2022, Royal took responsibility for a ransomware attack on one of the United Kingdom's most popular racing circuits - Silverstone Circuit. The attack held up dozens of Formula One races and motorcycle events. Details regarding the attack were not disclosed, but Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow stated that because Royal's ransomware is secure, its encryption cannot be broken. Callow also stated that unlike current ransomware groups, Royal uses multiple ransomware types and uses the .Royal extension for encrypted files rather than using randomly generated extensions.

Example 1:

'CTI': Vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers are currently being targeted by threat actors and infected with FARGO ransomware (also known as Mallox and TargetCompany). Microsoft's SQL servers hold data for internet services and apps. A disruption  to these databases by FARGO could cause severe issues for businesses. In February 2022, the threat actors behind FARGO attacks dropped Cobalt Strike beacons, and by July 2022, they were hijacking vulnerable Microsoft SQL servers to steal bandwidth for their own proxy services. The latest FARGO attacks blackmail database owners into paying the demanded ransom. If the owners refuse to pay the ransom, the threat actors threaten to expose their stolen files on Telegram. FARGO is one of the most popular ransomware strains that focuses on Microsoft SQL servers. The ransomware infection starts by using powershell.exe and cmd.exe to download a .NET file to a compromised machine. After the payload fetches additional malware, a .BAT file terminates certain processes and services. To ensure that businesses can't recover their data, FARGO executes the recovery deactivation command and kills processes prior to initiating encryption. Once encryption is complete, FARGO renames locked files using the '.Fargo3' extension and generates a ransom note titled 'RECOVERY FILES.txt'. The threat actors expect the demanded ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. Database servers are often compromised via brute-force, and if a threat actor is able to use brute-force in their attack, it's likely due to their target having weak credentials. The threat actor may also try to attack a database server by exploiting well-known and unpatched vulnerabilities. It's important that organizations keep their devices updated with the latest security patches and maintain strong passwords.

Example 2:

'CTI': In February 2022, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and the National Security Agency (NSA) released a joint statement regarding their observation of Iranian government-sponsored APT MuddyWater and their malicious cyber activity. MuddyWater is known for cyber espionage, as well as other cybercriminal operations as part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The threat actors have targeted several government and private sector organizations in the defense, oil and natural gas, local government, and telecommunications industries - focusing on Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. MuddyWater conducts broad cyber campaigns, exploiting publicly reported vulnerabilities and using open-source tools and strategies to gain access to their target's systems. Also, known as MERCURY, Earth Vetala, Static Kitten, Seedworm, and TEMP.Zagros, MuddyWater is an Iranian APT and a subservient element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The group has been active since 2018 and has provided stolen data and access to the Iranian government by exploiting known vulnerabilities and using open-source tools to deploy their ransomware. In November 2021, Cisco Talos observed a campaign targeting Turkey government entities, including the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey - Tubitak. MuddyWater has three goals when conducting their attacks: cyber espionage, intellectual property theft, and ransomware attacks.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Last week Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in partnership with The Citizen Lab, discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit chain for iPhones. Developed by the commercial surveillance vendor, Intellexa, this exploit chain is used to install its Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device. In response, yesterday, Apple patched the bugs in iOS 16.7 and iOS 17.0.1 as CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. This quick patching from Apple helps to better protect users and we encourage all iOS users to install them as soon as possible.
