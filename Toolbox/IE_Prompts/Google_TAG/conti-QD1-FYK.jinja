'CTI': Citrix urged customers on Tuesday to immediately patch Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances exposed online against two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. The two zero-days (tracked as CVE-2023-6548 and CVE-2023-6549) impact the Netscaler management interface and expose unpatched Netscaler instances to remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks, respectively. However, to gain code execution, attackers must be logged in to low-privilege accounts on the targeted instance and need access to NSIP, CLIP, or SNIP with management interface access. The Netscaler product versions affected by these two zero-day vulnerabilities include the following:' NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 before 14.1-12.35', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-51.15', 'NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-92.21', 'NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.176', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.302', 'NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.302'.

Example 1:

'CTI': A new vulnerability dubbed 'LeftoverLocals' affecting graphics processing units from AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and Imagination Technologies allows retrieving data from the local memory space. Tracked as CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations.

Example 2:

'CTI': GitHub rotated keys potentially exposed by a vulnerability patched in December that could let attackers access credentials within production containers via environment variables. This unsafe reflection vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2024-0200) can allow attackers to gain remote code execution on unpatched servers. GitHub also fixed a second high-severity Enterprise Server command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-0507) that would allow attackers using a Management Console user account with an editor role to escalate privileges.

Target report:

\"CTI\": In early September 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) observed a financially motivated threat actor we refer to as EXOTIC LILY, exploiting a 0day in Microsoft MSHTML (CVE-2021-40444). Investigating this group's activity, we determined they are an Initial Access Broker (IAB) who appear to be working with the Russian cyber crime gang known as FIN12 (Mandiant, FireEye) / WIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike). Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths of the security world, and it\u2019s a full-time job. These groups specialize in breaching a target in order to open the doors-or the Windows-to the malicious actor with the highest bid. EXOTIC LILY is a resourceful, financially motivated group whose activities appear to be closely linked with data exfiltration and deployment of human-operated ransomware such as Conti and Diavol. At the peak of EXOTIC LILY\u2019s activity, we estimate they were sending more than 5,000 emails a day, to as many as 650 targeted organizations globally. Up until November 2021, the group seemed to be targeting specific industries such as IT, cybersecurity and healthcare, but as of late we have seen them attacking a wide variety of organizations and industries, with less specific focus.
