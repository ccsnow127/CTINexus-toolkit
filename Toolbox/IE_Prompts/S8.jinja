Please read the text carefully and identify entities, classifying them into these specific types: [threat actor, attack pattern, campaign, identity, indicator, infrastructure, location, tool, vulnerability, malware]. Next, analyze the relationships between these entities. Use the following relationship categories as a guide: [use, target, is a, are, exploit, in, observe, generate, have, known as, be associated with, conduct, is likely a, are likely, include, be attributed to]. If a relationship doesn't fit into these categories, summarize the relationship in your own words, ensuring it is clearly defined and relevant to the context. Below are some examples.

"CTI": This malware family uses the .NET framework and leverages the domain name service (DNS) protocol to create a covert channel and provide different backdoor functionalities. Early this year, Ukrainian cybersecurity researchers found Fighting Ursa leveraging a zero-day exploit in Microsoft Outlook (now known as CVE-2023-23397). This vulnerability is especially concerning since it does not require user interaction to exploit. Unit 42 researchers have observed this group using CVE-2023-23397 over the past 20 months to target at least 30 organizations within 14 nations that are of likely strategic intelligence value to the Russian government and its military.

"CTI": SilverRAT shows that the region"s cybercriminal groups are becoming more sophisticated, according to Cyfirma"s analysis. The first version of SilverRAT, whose source code was leaked by unknown actors in October, consists of a builder that allows the user to construct a remote access Trojan with specific features. The more interesting features, according to Cyfirma"s analysis, include using either an IP address or webpage for command and control, bypasses for antivirus software, the ability to erase system restore points, and the delayed execution of payloads. At least two threat actors - one using the handle "Dangerous silver" and a second using "Monstermc" - are the developers behind both SilverRAT and a previous program, S500 RAT, according to Cyfirma"s analysis. The hackers operate on Telegram and through online forums where they sell malware-as-a-service, distribute cracked RATs from other developers, and offer a variety of other services. In addition, they have a blog and website called Anonymous Arabic.
