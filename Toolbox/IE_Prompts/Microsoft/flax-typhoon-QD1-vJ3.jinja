'CTI': Apple released security updates to address this year's first zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks that could impact iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs. The zero-day fixed today is tracked as CVE-2024-23222 and is a WebKit confusion issue that attackers could exploit to gain code execution on targeted devices. Successful exploitation enables threat actors to execute arbitrary malicious code on devices running vulnerable iOS, macOS, and tvOS versions after opening a malicious web page.

Example 1:

'CTI': A new vulnerability dubbed 'LeftoverLocals' affecting graphics processing units from AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and Imagination Technologies allows retrieving data from the local memory space. Tracked as CVE-2023-4969, the security issue enables data recovery from vulnerable GPUs, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) processes. LeftoverLocals lets attackers launch a 'listener' - a GPU kernel that reads from uninitialized local memory and can dump the data in a persistent location, such as the global memory. If the local memory is not cleared, the attacker can use the listener to read values left behind by the 'writer' - a program that stores values to local memory. The recovered data can reveal sensitive information about the victim's computations, including model inputs, outputs, weights, and intermediate computations.

Example 2:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Target report:

\"CTI\": Flax Typhoon has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted government agencies and education, critical manufacturing, and information technology organizations in Taiwan. Some victims have also been observed elsewhere in Southeast Asia, as well as in North America and Africa. Flax Typhoon focuses on persistence, lateral movement, and credential access. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments. Flax Typhoon is known to use the China Chopper web shell, Metasploit, Juicy Potato privilege escalation tool, Mimikatz, and SoftEther virtual private network (VPN) client. However, Flax Typhoon primarily relies on living-off-the-land techniques and hands-on-keyboard activity. Flax Typhoon achieves initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing servers and deploying web shells like China Chopper. Following initial access, Flax Typhoon uses command-line tools to first establish persistent access over the remote desktop protocol, then deploy a VPN connection to actor-controlled network infrastructure, and finally collect credentials from compromised systems. Flax Typhoon further uses this VPN access to scan for vulnerabilities on targeted systems and organizations from the compromised systems.
