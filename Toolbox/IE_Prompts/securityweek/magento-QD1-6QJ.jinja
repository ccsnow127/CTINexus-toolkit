'CTI': Discovered in August 2021, Quantum ransomware is linked to the Quantum Locker operation. Quantum Locker has had a few rebrands (AstroLocker, MountLocker, and XingLocker). Our technology partner, AdvIntel, confirmed that Quantum is a splinter group from Conti and that the ransomware operation was taken over by Conti Team Two in April 2022 - keeping Quantum's original name. In June 2022, Quantum was observed employing their version of BazarCall, called Jormungandr, and hiring people who specialized in OSINT, spamming, design, and call center operations. BazarCall is a method that is also known as call-back phishing. This tactic emerged in early 2021 as an attack vector used by Ryuk ransomware (later evolving into Conti). BazarCall is used to gain initial access into a victim's network and involves emailing victims. The emails allege that a paid subscription is up for automatic renewal, but the renewal can be cancelled if the victim calls a specific number. Once the victim calls the number, the threat actor on the other end of the line convinces the victim via social engineering to start a remote access session by the use of legitimate software controlled by a network intruder. While the victim is distracted on the call, the intruder tries to figure out how to compromise the victim's network without triggering alarms. These kinds of attacks are highly targeted and make it difficult for cyber security professionals to detect due to the social engineering aspect of the attack. AdvIntel believes that the switch to social engineering is more than likely due to the predictability of ransomware attacks, causing profits to decline for adversaries. If threat actors like Quantum are able to trick people, they can have a more flexible approach to their attacks - making them difficult to defend. Quantum's BazarCall campaigns have grown more sophisticated in just two months' time. They've impersonated a large number of brands, including: Gobble, Luchechko Mortgage Team, CrowdStrike, HelloFresh, Oracle, Ginyard International US Equal Opportunity Employment Commission

Example 1:

'CTI': The Akira ransomware group, a relatively new player in the ransomware market, has claimed responsibility for three recent attacks. The victims include 4LEAF, an American engineering consultancy business; Park-Rite, a U.S.-based packaging materials manufacturer; and Family Day Care Services, a Canadian childcare service. Akira listed the names of the three victims on their leak site threatening to release company records if they refuse to pay a ransom. Researchers discovered the ransomware Trojan on August 28, 2017, and at that time, it appeared to be in its testing phase. The Trojan is currently being distributed by targeting unprotected websites, with a specific focus on WordPress sites. Once infected, Akira drops one or multiple payload files. After infection, a ransom note is left before the ransomware creates multiple registry values in Windows, such as the Run and RunOnce registries. The presence of .akira files means that your data has likely been encrypted by Akira ransomware.

Example 2:

'CTI': Fancy Bear, also known as APT 28, Sofacy, or Swallowtail, is a cyberespionage group that is linked to the Russian government. The group has been in operation since 2008, targeting the energy, government, media, aerospace, and defense sectors via phishing campaigns and credential harvesting. Fancy Bear is known to target both computers and mobile devices, running multiple intrusion operations concurrently. In 2016, Fancy Bear was front and center after they attacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The group was also responsible for leaking confidential drug testing information after they attacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) during the same year. Fancy Bear took credit for the attack and leaked the stolen information on a site named Fancy Bears. Despite two very public attacks, Fancy Bear returned to the shadows in 2017. Since that time, the group's activities have become clandestine, motivated by intelligence gathering. Between 2017 and 2018, Fancy Bear targeted the following organizations: European military, European government, A South American country's government, An Eastern European embassy, A prominent international organization. After much attention, Fancy Bear became more discreet, and not much was heard from the APT until their recent attacks on Ukrainians. In July 2022, researchers from Malwarebytes observed malicious activity from the group. They were sending malicious documents that contained an exploit for the Microsoft zero-day, Follina (CVE-2022-30190).

Target report:

\"CTI\": Threat actors are exploiting a critical vulnerability in Magento to inject a persistent backdoor into ecommerce websites, cybersecurity firm Sansec reports. The issue, tracked as CVE-2024-20720 (CVSS score of 9.1), is described as an OS command injection flaw leading to arbitrary code execution without user interaction. Adobe resolved the critical vulnerability in February 2024 in both Adobe Commerce and Magento, as part of its Tuesday Patch updates. However, it appears that there are websites that have yet to be updated and remain vulnerable to exploitation. According to Sansec, threat actors have discovered a clever way to exploit CVE-2024-20720, using a crafted layout template in the database to inject XML code that can reinfect Magento servers even after a manual fix. Attackers combine the Magento layout parser with the beberlei/assert package (installed by default) to execute system commands. Because the layout block is tied to the checkout cart, this command is executed whenever <store>/checkout/cart is requested. As part of the observed attacks, the backdoor is added to the automatically generated content management system (CMS) controller, ensuring the backdoor is periodically reinjected and providing persistent remote code execution via POST commands. The threat actors have employed the mechanism to inject a fake Stripe payment skimmer and steal payment data from the compromised web stores.
