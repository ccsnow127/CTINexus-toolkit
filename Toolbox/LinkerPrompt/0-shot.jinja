"Question": What do you think is the relationship between entity "{{ main_node }}" and entity "{{ topic_node }}"
---------------------
Your response should follow the format:
"predicted_triple": { "subject": predicted_subject, "relation": predicted_relation, "object": predicted_object }
Return JSON object and nothing else, predicted_subject and predicted_object should be chosen from entity "{{ main_node }}" and entity "{{ topic_node }}", do not come up with new entity. Predicted relation doesn't need to be one word, it can be a phrase. For example, "is attacked by" is a valid relation.
